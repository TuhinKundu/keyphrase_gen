it is nontrivial to mine sequential patterns incrementally , especially when the existing sequences grow incrementally because such growth may lead to the generation of many new patterns due to the

distributed rdf repositories . <sep> a technical infrastructure for storing , querying and managing rdf data is a key element in the current semantic web development . systems like jena , sesame or the ics forth rdf suite are widely used for building semantic web applications . currently , none of these systems supports the integrated querying of distributed rdf repositories . we consider this a major shortcoming since the semantic web is distributed by nature . in this paper we present an architecture for querying distributed rdf repositories by extending the existing sesame system . we discuss the implications of our architecture and propose an index structure as well as algorithms for query processing and optimization in such a distributed context . categories and subject descriptors e . <digit> data data structures distributed data structures h . <digit> . <digit> information systems database management sys tems distributed databases , query processing general terms algorithms , performance , design motivation the need for handling multiple sources of knowledge and information is quite obvious in the context of semantic web applications . first of all we have the duality of schema and information content where multiple information sources can adhere to the same schema . further , the re use , extension and combination of multiple schema files is considered to be common practice on the semantic web <digit> . despite the inherently distributed nature of the semantic web , most current rdf infrastructures ( for example <digit> ) store information locally as a single knowledge repository , i . e . , rdf models from remote sources are replicated locally and merged into a single model . distribution is virtually retained through the use of namespaces to distinguish between different models . we argue that many interesting applications on the semantic web would benefit from or even require an rdf infrastructure that supports real distribution of information sources that can be accessed from a single point . beyond the argument of conceptual adequacy , there are a number of technical reasons for real distribution in the spirit of distributed databases freshness the commonly used approach of using a local copy of a remote source suffers from the problem of changing information . directly using the remote source frees us from the need of managing change as we are always working with the original . flexibility keeping different sources separate from each other provides us with a greater flexibility concerning the addition and removal of sources . in the distributed setting , we only have to adjust the corresponding system parameters . in many cases , it will even be unavoidable to adopt a distributed architecture , for example in scenarios in which the data is not owned by the person querying it . in this case , it will often not be permitted to copy the data . more and more information providers , however , create interfaces that can be used to query the information . the same holds for cases where the information sources are too large to just create a single model containing all the information , but they still can be queried using a special interface ( musicbrainz is an example of this case ) . further , we might want to include sources that are not available in rdf , but that can be wrapped to produce query results in rdf format . a typical example is the use of a free text index as one source of information . sometimes there is not even a fixed model that could be stored in rdf , because the result of a query is only calculated at runtime ( google , for instance , provides a programming interface that could be wrapped into an rdf source ) . in all these scenarios , we are forced to access external information sources from an rdf infrastructure without being able to create a local copy of the information we want to query . on the semantic web , we almost always want to combine such external sources with each other and with additional schema knowledge . this confirms the need to consider an rdf infrastructure that deals with information sources that are actually distributed across different locations . in this paper , we address the problem of integrated access to distributed rdf repositories from a practical point of view . in particular , starting from a real life use case where we are considering a number of distributed sources that contain research results in the form of publications , we take the existing rdf storage and retrieval system sesame and describe how the architecture and the query processing methods of the system have to be extended in order to move to a distributed setting . the paper is structured as follows . in section <digit> we present an extension of the sesame architecture to multiple , distributed repositories and discuss basic assumptions and implications of the architecture . section <digit> presents source index hierarchies as suitable mechanisms to support the localization of relevant data during query processing . in section <digit> we introduce a cost model for processing queries in the distributed architecture , and show its use in optimizing query execution as a basis for the two phase optimization heuristics for join ordering . section <digit> reviews previous work on index structures for object oriented data bases . it also summarizes related work on query optimization particularly focusing on the join ordering problem . we conclude with a discussion of open problems and future work .", "a functional

only to an audience in a relatively narrow region . similarly , some search engine queries ( implicitly ) target global pages , while other queries are after local pages . for example , the best results for query wildflowers are probably global pages about wildflowers such as the one discussed above . however , local pages that are relevant to , say , san francisco are likely to be good matches for a query houses for sale that was issued by a san francisco resident or by somebody moving to that city . unfortunately , search engines do not analyze the geographical locality of queries and users , and hence often produce sub optimal results . thus query wildflowers might return pages that discuss wildflowers in specific u . s . states ( and not general information about wildflowers ) , while query houses for sale might return pages with real estate listings for locations other than that of interest to the person who issued the query . deciding whether an unseen query should produce mostly local or global pages without placing this burden on the search engine users is an important and challenging problem , because queries are often ambiguous or underspecify the information they are after . in this paper , we address this problem by first defining how to categorize queries according to their ( often implicit ) geographical locality . we then introduce several

becoming quite common . many dissemination schemes have been proposed but most of them push data to wireless channels for general consumption . push based broadcast <digit> is essentially asymmetric , i . e . , the volume of data being higher from the server to the users than from the users back to the server . push based scheme requires some indexing which indicates when the data will be broadcast and its position in the broadcast . access latency and tuning time are the two main parameters which may be used to evaluate an indexing scheme . two of the important indexing schemes proposed earlier were tree based and the exponential indexing schemes . none of these schemes were able to address the requirements of location dependent data ( ldd ) which is highly desirable feature of data dissemination . in this paper , we discuss the broadcast of ldd in our project data in your space ( days ) , and propose a scheme for indexing ldd . we argue that this scheme , when applied to ldd ,

related machines . <sep> in this paper we study the problem of assigning unit size tasks to related machines when only limited online information is provided to each task . this is a general framework whose special cases are the classical multiple choice games for the assignment of unit size tasks to identical machines . the latter case was the subject of intensive research for the last decade . the problem is intriguing in the sense that the natural extensions of the greedy oblivious schedulers , which are known to achieve near optimal performance in the case of identical machines , are proved to perform quite poorly in the case of the related machines . in this work we present a rather surprising lower bound stating that any oblivious scheduler that assigns an arbitrary number of tasks to n related machines would need log n loglog n polls of machine loads per task , in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio versus the optimum offline assignment of the same input sequence to these machines . on the other hand , we prove that the missing information for an oblivious scheduler to perform almost optimally , is the amount of tasks to be inserted into the system . in particular , we provide an oblivious scheduler that only uses o ( loglog n ) polls , along with the additional information of the size of the input sequence , in order to achieve a constant competitive ratio vs . the optimum offline assignment . the philosophy of this scheduler is based on an interesting exploitation of the slowfit concept ( <digit> , <digit> , <digit> for a survey see <digit> , <digit> , <digit> ) for the assignment of the tasks to the related machines despite the restrictions on the provided online information , in combination with a layered induction argument for bounding the tails of the number of tasks passing from slower to faster machines . we finally use this oblivious scheduler as the core of an adaptive scheduler that does not demand the knowledge of the input sequence and yet achieves almost the same performance .", "machine learning for information architecture in a large governmental website . <sep> this paper describes ongoing research into

individual records , we aim to restrict the set of queries that can be feasibly evaluated on the encrypted database . we start with a simple form of database obfuscation which makes database records indistinguishable from lookup functions . the only feasible operation on an obfuscated record is to look up some attribute y by supplying the value of another attribute x that appears in the same record ( i . e . , someone who does not know x can not feasibly retrieve y ) . we then ( i ) generalize our construction to conjunctions of equality tests on any attributes of the database , and ( ii

precisely , but mass harvesting queries matching a large number of records are computationally infeasible . our constructions are non interactive . the database is transformed in such a way that all

share data dispersed over different peer sources . while integrating data for answering user queries , it often happens that inconsistencies arise , because some integrity constraints specified on peers ' global schemas may be violated . in these cases , we may give semantics to the inconsistent system by suitably repairing the retrieved data , as typically done in the context of traditional data integration systems . however , some specific features of p2p systems , such as peer autonomy and peer preferences ( e . g . , different source trusting ) , should be properly addressed to make the whole approach effective . in this paper , we face these issues that were only marginally considered in the literature . we first present a formal framework for reasoning about autonomous peers that exploit individual preference criteria in repairing the data . the idea is that queries should be answered over the best possible database repairs with respect to the preferences of all peers , i . e . , the states on which they are able to find an agreement . then , we investigate the computational complexity of dealing with peer agreements and of answering queries in p2p data integration

working with diverse information sources with possibly different formats and information models may recognize and wish to express conceptual structures that are not explicitly present in those sources . rather than replicate the portions of interest and recast them into a single , combined data source , we leave base information where it is and superimpose a conceptual model that is appropriate to the task at hand . this superimposed model can be distinct from the model ( s ) employed by the sources in the base layer . an application that superimposes a new conceptual model over diverse sources , with varying capabilities , needs to accommodate the various types of information and differing access protocols for the base information sources . the superimposed pluggable architecture for contexts and excerpts ( sparce ) defines a collection of architectural abstractions , placed between superimposed and base applications , to demarcate and revisit information elements inside base sources and provide access to content and context for elements inside these sources . sparce accommodates new base information types without altering existing superimposed applications . in this paper , we briefly introduce several superimposed applications that we have built , and describe the conceptual model each superimposes . we then focus on the use of context in superimposed applications . we describe how sparce supports context and excerpts . we demonstrate how sparce facilitates building superimposed applications by describing its use in building our two , quite diverse applications

random coordinated scheduling algorithm for bluetooth scatternets . <sep> the emergence of bluetooth as a default radio interface allows handheld devices to be rapidly interconnected into ad hoc networks . bluetooth allows large numbers of piconets to form a scatternet using designated nodes that participate in multiple piconets . a unit that participates in multiple piconets can serve as a bridge and forwards traffic between neighbouring piconets . since a bluetooth unit can transmit or receive in only one piconet at a time , a bridging unit has to share its time among the different piconets . to schedule communication with bridging nodes one must take into account their availability in the different piconets , which represents a difficult , scatternet wide coordination problem and can be an important performance bottleneck in building scatternets . in this paper we propose the pseudo random coordinated scatternet scheduling ( pcss ) algorithm to perform the scheduling of both intra and inter piconet communication . in this algorithm bluetooth nodes assign meeting points with their peers such that the sequence of meeting points follows a pseudo random process that is different for each pair of nodes . the uniqueness of the pseudo random sequence guarantees that the meeting points with different peers of the node will collide only occasionally . this removes the need for explicit information exchange between peer devices , which is a major advantage of the algorithm . the lack of explicit signaling between bluetooth nodes makes it easy to deploy the pcss algorithm in bluetooth devices , while conformance to the current bluetooth specification is also maintained . to assess the performance of the algorithm we define two reference case schedulers and perform simulations in a number of scenarios where we compare the performance of pcss to the performance of the reference schedulers .", "run time dynamic linking for reprogramming wireless sensor

the packet to the sink . although structure less approaches can address these issues , the performance does not scale well with the network size . we propose a semi structured approach that uses a structure less technique locally followed by dynamic forwarding on an implicitly constructed packet forwarding structure to support network scalability . the structure , tod , is composed of multiple shortest path trees . after performing local aggregation , nodes dynamically decide the forwarding tree based on the location of the sources . the key principle behind tod is that adjacent nodes in a

retrieval performance such as average precision , r precision , and precision at cutoffs . our methodology treats the value of such a measure as a constraint on the distribution of relevant documents in an unknown list , and the maximum entropy distribution can be determined subject to these constraints . for good measures of overall performance ( such as average precision ) , the resulting maximum entropy distributions are highly correlated with actual distributions of relevant documents in lists as demonstrated through trec data for poor measures of overall performance , the correlation is weaker . as such , the maximum entropy method can be used to quantify the overall quality of a retrieval measure . furthermore , for good measures of overall performance ( such as average precision ) , we show that the corresponding maximum entropy distributions can be used to accurately infer precision recall curves and the values of other measures of performance , and we demonstrate that the quality of these inferences far exceeds that predicted by simple retrieval measure correlation , as demonstrated through trec data . categories and subject descriptors h . <digit>

the motion streams have multiple attributes , and motion patterns in the streams can have different lengths from those of isolated motion patterns and different attributes can have different temporal shifts and variations . to address these issues , this paper proposes a similarity measure based on singular value decomposition ( svd ) of motion matrices . eigenvector differences weighed by the

the slowing pace of commodity microprocessor performance improvements combined with ever increasing chip power demands has become of utmost concern to computational scientists . as a result , the high performance computing community is examining alternative architectures that address the limitations of modern cache based designs . in this work , we examine the potential of using the forthcoming sti cell processor as a building block for future high end computing systems . our work contains several novel contributions . first , we introduce a performance model for cell and apply it to several key scientific computing kernels dense matrix multiply , sparse matrix vector multiply , stencil computations , and 1d 2d ffts . the difficulty of programming cell , which requires assembly level intrinsics for the best performance , makes this model useful as an initial step in algorithm design and evaluation . next , we validate the accuracy of our model by comparing results against

cooperative discovery and selection of web services with a focus on personalization . to find the most useful service in each instance of a request , not only explicit parameters of the request have to be matched against the service offers . also user preferences or implicit assumptions of a user with respect to common knowledge in a certain domain have to be considered to improve the quality of service provisioning . in the area of web services the notion of service ontologies together with cooperative answering techniques can take a lot of this responsibility . however , without quality assessments for the relaxation of service requests and queries a personalized service discovery and selection is virtually impossible . this paper focuses on assessing the semantic meaning of query relaxation plans over multiple conceptual views of the service ontology , each one representing a soft query constraint of the user request . our focus is on the question what constitutes a minimum

this paper we introduce a probabilistic framework to exploit hierarchy , structure sharing and duration information for topic transition detection in videos . our probabilistic detection framework is a combination of a shot classification step and a detection phase using hierarchical probabilistic models . we consider two models in this paper the extended hierarchical hidden markov model ( hhmm ) and the coxian switching hidden semi markov model ( s hsmm ) because they allow the natural decomposition of semantics in videos , including shared structures , to be modeled directly , and thus enabling efficient inference and reducing the sample complexity in learning . additionally , the s hsmm allows the duration information to be incorporated , consequently the modeling of long term dependencies in videos is enriched through both hierarchical and duration modeling . furthermore , the use of the coxian distribution in the s hsmm makes it tractable to deal with long sequences in video . our experimentation of the proposed framework on twelve educational and training videos shows that both models outperform the baseline cases ( flat hmm and hsmm ) and performances reported in earlier work in topic detection . the superior performance of the s hsmm over the hhmm verifies our belief that duration information is an important factor in video content modeling . categories and

<digit> ) topic characterization identifying the characteristics for each of main topics . for real topic analysis systems , we may require that these three tasks be performed in an on line fashion

topic structure is modeled using a finite mixture model and that any change of a topic trend is tracked by learning the finite mixture model dynamically . in this framework we propose the usage of a time stamp based discounting learning algorithm in order to realize real time topic structure identification . this enables tracking the topic structure adaptively by forgetting out of date statistics . further we apply the theory of dynamic model selection to detecting changes of main components in the finite mixture model in order to realize topic emergence detection . we demonstrate the

of available information is a main challenge . additionally , there is a growing need for the seamless mobile and multi modal system usage throughout the whole day to meet the requirements of the modern society ( anytime , anywhere , anyhow ) . a personal information agent that is delivering the right information at the right time by accessing , filtering and presenting information in a situation aware matter is needed . applying agent technology is promising , because the inherent capabilities of agents like autonomy , pro and reactiveness offer an adequate approach . we developed an agent based personal information system called pia for collecting , filtering , and integrating information at a common point , offering access to the information by www , e mail , sms , mms , and j2me clients . push and pull techniques are combined allowing the user to search explicitly for specific information on the one hand and to be informed automatically about relevant information divided in pre , work and recreation slots on the other hand . in the core of the pia system advanced filtering techniques are deployed through multiple filtering agent communities for content based and collaborative filtering . information extracting agents are constantly gathering new relevant information from a variety of selected sources ( internet , files , databases , web services etc . ) . a

retrieval system based on associative networks . <sep> in this paper we present a multilingual information retrieval system that provides access to tourism information by exploiting the intuitiveness of natural language . in particular , we describe the knowledge representation model underlying the information retrieval system . this knowledge representation approach is based on associative networks and allows the definition of semantic relationships between domain intrinsic information items . the network structure is used to define weighted associations between information items and augments the system with a fuzzy search strategy . this particular search strategy is performed by a constrained spreading activation algorithm that implements information retrieval on associative networks . strictly speaking , we take the relatedness of terms into account and show , how this fuzzy search strategy yields beneficial results and , moreover , determines highly associated matches to users ' queries . thus , the combination of the associative network and the constrained spreading activation approach constitutes a search algorithm that evaluates the relatedness of terms and , therefore , provides a means for implicit query expansion .", "an analytical model based on g m <digit> with self similar input to provide end to end qos in 3g networks . <sep> the dramatic increase in demand for wireless internet access has lead to the introduction of new wireless architectures and systems including 3g , wi fi and wimax . 3g systems such as umts and cdma2000 are leaning towards an all ip architecture for transporting ip multimedia services , mainly due to its scalability and promising capability of inter working heterogeneous wireless access networks . during the last ten years , substantial work has been done to understand the nature of wired ip traffic and it has been proven that ip traffic exhibits self similar properties and burstiness over a large range of time scales . recently , because of the large deployment of new wireless architectures , researchers have focused their attention towards understanding the nature of traffic carried by different wireless architecture and early studies have shown that wireless data traffic also exhibits strong long range dependency . thus , the classical tele traffic theory based on a simple markovian process can not be used to evaluate the performance of wireless networks . unfortunately , the area of understanding and modeling of different kinds of wireless traffic is still immature which constitutes a problem since it is crucial to guarantee tight bound qos parameters to heterogeneous end users of the mobile internet . in this paper , we make several contributions to the accurate modeling of wireless ip

"an expressive aspect language for system applications with arachne . <sep> c applications , in particular those using operating system level services , frequently comprise multiple crosscutting concerns network protocols and security are typical examples of such concerns . while these concerns can partially be addressed during design and implementation of an application , they frequently become an issue at runtime , e . g . , to avoid server downtime . a deployed network protocol might not be efficient enough and may thus need to be replaced . buffer overflows might be discovered that imply critical breaches in the security model of an application . a prefetching strategy may be required to enhance performance . while aspect oriented programming seems attractive in this context , none of the current aspect systems is expressive and efficient enough to address such concerns . this paper presents a new aspect system to provide a solution to this problem . while efficiency considerations have played an important part in the design of the aspect language , the language allows aspects to be expressed more concisely than previous approaches . in particular , it allows aspect programmers to quantify over sequences of execution points as well as over accesses through variable aliases . we show how the former can be used to modularize the replacement of network protocols and the latter to prevent buffer overflows . we also present an implementation of the language as an extension of arachne , a dynamic weaver for c applications . finally , we present

expressive 3d animation environment that enables users to rapidly and visually prototype animated worlds with a fully 3d user interface . a 3d device allows the specification of complex 3d motion , while virtual tools are visible mediators that live in the same 3d space as application objects and supply the interaction metaphors to control them . in our environment , there is no intrinsic difference between user interface and application objects . multi way constraints provide the necessary tight coupling among components that makes it possible to seamlessly compose animated and interactive behaviors . by recording the effects of manipulations , all the expressive power of the 3d user interface is exploited to define animations . effective editing of recorded manipulations is made possible by compacting all continuous parameter evolutions with an incremental data reduction algorithm , designed to preserve both geometry and timing . the automatic generation of editable representations of interactive performances overcomes one of the major limitations of current performance animation systems . novel interactive solutions to animation problems are made possible by the tight integration of all system components . in particular , animations can be synchronized by using constrained manipulation during playback . the accompanying video tape illustrates our approach

that is appropriate for each test case . current approaches either require exact database states to be specified in advance , or else generate a single initial state ( under guidance from the user ) that is intended to be suitable for execution of all test cases . the first method allows large test suites to be executed in batch , but requires considerable programmer effort to create the test

nodes during message routing , significantly reduces the amount of communication and hence the energy consumed . recently several researchers have proposed robust aggregation frameworks , which combine multi path routing schemes with duplicate insensitive algorithms , to accurately compute aggregates ( e . g . , sum , count , average ) in spite of message losses resulting from node and transmission failures . however , these aggregation frameworks have been designed without security in mind . given the lack of hardware support for tamper resistance and the unattended nature of sensor nodes , sensor networks are highly vulnerable to node compromises . we show that even if a few compromised nodes contribute false sub aggregate values , this results in large errors in the aggregate computed at the root of the hierarchy . we present modifications to the aggregation algorithms that guard against such attacks , i . e . , we present algorithms for resilient hierarchical

detection systems are an important and widely accepted security tool in computer and wireless sensor networks . their aim is to detect misbehaving or faulty nodes in order to take appropriate countermeasures , thus limiting the damage caused by adversaries as well as by hard or software faults . so far , however , once detected , misbehaving nodes have just been isolated from the rest of the sensor network and hence are no longer usable by running applications . in the presence of an adversary or software faults , this proceeding will inevitably lead to an early and complete loss of

that many general constructions of cryptographic schemes ( e . g . , cpa secure encryption ) refer to the underlying primitive in a black box way only , there are some constructions that are inherently nonblack box . indeed , all known constructions of protocols for general secure computation that are secure in the presence of a malicious adversary and without an honest majority use the underlying primitive in a nonblack box way ( requiring to prove in zero knowledge statements that relate to the primitive ) . in this paper , we study whether such nonblack box use is essential . we present protocols that use only black box access to a family of ( enhanced ) trapdoor permutations or to a homomorphic public key encryption scheme . the result is a protocol whose communication

method to reconstruct and estimate partially occluded shapes and regions of objects in images from overlapping and cutting . we present the robust method for recognizing partially occluded objects based on symmetry properties , which is based on the contours of objects . our method provides simple techniques to reconstruct occluded regions via a region copy using the symmetry axis within an object . based on the estimated parameters for partially occluded objects , we perform object recognition on the classification tree . since our method relies on reconstruction of the object based on the symmetry rather than statistical estimates , it has proven to be remarkably robust in recognizing partially occluded objects in the presence of scale changes , rotation , and viewpoint changes .",

perform well on one criterion may not perform well on other criteria . for example , svms and boosting are designed to optimize accuracy , whereas neural nets typically optimize squared error or cross entropy . we conducted an empirical study using a variety of learning methods ( svms , neural nets , k nearest neighbor , bagged and boosted trees , and boosted stumps ) to compare nine boolean classification performance metrics accuracy , lift , f score , area under the roc curve , average precision , precision recall break even point , squared error , cross entropy , and probability

squared error , cross entropy , and calibration , lay in one part of metric space far away from metrics that depend on the relative order of the predicted values roc area , average precision , break

have excellent performance on metrics like accuracy , but perform poorly on probability metrics such as squared error . what was not expected was that the margin methods have excellent performance on ordering metrics such as roc area and average precision . we introduce a new metric , sar , that combines squared error , accuracy , and roc area into one metric . mds and correlation analysis shows

master and slave roles . our structure dbblue also enjoys a nice routing property the diameter of the graph is and we can find a path with at most hops for every pair of nodes without any routing table . moreover , the congestion of every node is at most , assuming that a unit of total traffic demand is equally distributed among all pair of nodes . we discuss in detail a vigorous method to locally update the structure dbblue using at most communications when a node joins or leaves the network . in most cases , the cost of updating the scatternet is actually since a node can join or

software development process . nevertheless , the <unk> tion of a domain specific language is hindered by the difficulty of transitioning to different language syntax and employing a separate translator in the software build process . we present a methodology that simplifies the development and deployment of small language extensions , in the context of java . the main language design principle is that of language extension through unobtrusive annotations . the main language implementation idea is to express the language as a generator of customized aspectj aspects , using our meta aspectj tool . the advantages of the approach are twofold . first , the tool integrates into an existing software application much as a regular api or library , instead of as a language extension . this means that the programmer can remove the language extension at any point and choose to implement the required functionality by hand without needing to rewrite the client code . second , a mature language implementation is easy to achieve with little effort since aspectj takes care of the low level issues of interfacing with the base java language . categories and subject descriptors d . <digit> . <digit> programming techniques automatic programming d . <digit> . <digit> software engineering reusable software d . <digit> . <digit> programming languages language constructs and features general terms domain specific languages , language extensions introduction and motivation the idea of extensible languages has fascinated programmers for many decades , as evident by the extensibility features in languages as old as lisp . from a software engineering standpoint , the main advantages of expressing a concept as a language feature , as opposed to a library api , are in terms of conciseness , safety , and performance . a language feature allows expressing the programmer ' s intent much more concisely in contrast , libraries are limited to a function or method call syntax . a language feature also allow better static error checking a library can only check the static types of arguments of a function call against the declared types of the formals . finally , a language feature can take advantage of context information and employ an optimized implementation , while a library routine can not be customized according to its uses . despite these advantages , there are excellent reasons why full language extensibility is undesirable . changing the syntax and semantics of a programming language is confusing and can lead to incomprehensible code . furthermore , programming languages are complex entities , designed to provide a small number of features but allow them to be combined as generally as possible . a new feature can either increase the complexity of the language implementation significantly ( because of interactions with all existing features ) , or will need to be limited in its interactions , which is a bad language design principle that leads to single use features and design bloat . in past work <digit> , we have advocated expressing small language extensions purely through unobtrusive annotations . indeed , the introduction of user defined annotations in mainstream programming languages , such as c and java , has allowed specialized language extensions ( e . g . , for distributed computing , persistence , or real time programming ) to be added without changing the base syntax . we believe that the approach of limited language extension through annotations meshes very well with an implementation technique that uses our meta aspectj ( maj ) tool <digit> to express the semantics of the language extension . specifically , maj is a language that allows writing programs that generate aspects in the aspectj language <digit> . the programmer can easily express an extension to the java language as a program that a ) reads annotations and type information from an existing program using java reflection b ) outputs a customized aspectj aspect that transforms the original program according to the information in the annotation c ) executes the generated aspect by using the standard aspectj compiler . in other words , our approach uses the aspectj language as a compiler back end . aspectj code is not written by the application programmer but generated by the language extension , for the sole purpose of expressing program transformations easily and generally . this is appropriate , as aspectj embodies the aspect oriented programming <digit> philosophy of expressing program enhancements orthogonally and independently of the original source code . our approach has the advantage of simplifying the implementation of the language extension significantly , without encouraging undisciplined language extension ( since the only extensions allowed are through annotations ) . specifically , the approach leverages the engineering sophistication of the aspectj compiler implementation and its provisions for dealing correctly with different java language features . if a programmer were to replicate the same effort by hand , she would likely need to reproduce much of the aspectj compiler complexity . the purpose of this paper is to support the idea of implementing small language extensions as programs that produce aspects . we have recently implemented a number of such small extensions to java and they all exhibit a striking simplicity . specifically , we did not have to implement ( or extend ) a java parser , we did not need to deal with syntax tree pattern matching and transformation , and we did not need to provide special handling for many java complexities . the combined annotations maj approach ensured that our small language extensions were implementable in a few hundreds of lines of code , without sacrificing generality in their conditions of use . we discuss two such extensions in detail , after first introducing the maj language .", "hourly analysis of a very large topically

in this paper , we identify the implications of a banked memory environment in supporting memory resident databases , and propose hardware ( memory directed ) and software ( query directed ) schemes

in reducing the energy consumption than the respective hardware schemes ( hosted in the memory controller ) , due to their complete knowledge of query access patterns . we extend this further and propose a query restructuring scheme and a multi query optimization . queries are restructured and regrouped based on their table access patterns to maximize the likelihood that data accesses are

with differing security levels failure to show separation of data may require the entire system to be validated at the higher integrity level . in this paper we show how the information flow model enforced by the spark examiner provides support for enforcing these security and safety models . we describe an extension to the spark variable annotations which allows the specification of a security or safety level for each state variable , and an extension to the spark analysis which automatically enforces a given information flow policy on a spark program . categories and subject descriptors d2

paradox has been explained in terms of a coupling between the macro level that hosts self organization ( and an apparent reduction in entropy ) , and the micro level ( where random processes greatly increase entropy ) . metaphorically , the micro level serves as an entropy sink , permitting overall system entropy to increase while sequestering this increase from the interactions where self organization is desired . we make this metaphor precise by constructing a simple example of pheromone based coordination , defining a way to measure the shannon entropy at the macro ( agent ) and micro ( pheromone ) levels , and exhibiting an entropy based view of the coordination .", "entropy based sensor selection heuristic for target localization . <sep> we propose an entropy based sensor

heuristic is also computationally much simpler than the mutual information based approaches . the effectiveness of the heuristic is evaluated using localization simulations in which gaussian sensing

their large scale counterparts in that they are relatively inexpensive to build , and can provide more precise and complete search capability over their relevant domains . one disadvantage such systems have over large scale search engines is the lack of global pagerank values . such information is needed to assess the value of pages in the localized search domain within the context of the web as a whole . in this paper , we present well motivated algorithms to estimate the global pagerank values of a local domain . the algorithms are all highly scalable in that , given a local domain of size n , they use o ( n ) resources that include computation time , bandwidth , and storage . we test our methods across a variety of localized domains , including site specific domains and topic

online news available today , there is an increasing need for automatic techniques to analyze and present news to the user in a meaningful and efficient manner . previous research focused only on organizing news stories by their topics into a flat hierarchy . we believe viewing a news topic as a flat collection of stories is too restrictive and inefficient for a user to understand the topic quickly . in this work , we attempt to capture the rich structure of events and their dependencies in a news topic through our event models . we call the process of recognizing events and their dependencies event threading . we believe our perspective of modeling the structure of a topic is more effective in capturing its semantics than a flat list of on topic stories . we formally define the novel problem , suggest evaluation metrics and present a few techniques for solving the problem . besides the standard word based features , our approaches take into account novel features such as temporal locality of stories for event recognition and time ordering for capturing dependencies . our experiments on a manually labeled data sets show that our models <unk> tively identify the events

"evolutionary learning with kernels a generic solution for large margin problems . <sep> in this paper we embed evolutionary computation into statistical learning theory . first , we outline the connection between large margin optimization and statistical learning and see why this paradigm is successful for many pattern recognition problems . we then embed evolutionary computation into the most prominent representative of this class of learning methods , namely into support vector machines ( svm ) . in contrast to former applications of evolutionary algorithms to svms we do not only optimize the method or kernel parameters . we rather use both evolution strategies and particle swarm optimization in order to directly solve the posed constrained optimization problem . transforming the problem into the wolfe dual reduces the total runtime and allows the usage of kernel functions . exploiting the knowledge about this optimization problem leads to a hybrid mutation which further decreases convergence time while classification accuracy is preserved . we will show that evolutionary svms are at least as accurate as their quadratic programming counterparts on six real world benchmark data sets . the evolutionary svm variants frequently outperform their quadratic programming competitors . additionally , the proposed algorithm is more generic than existing traditional solutions since it will also work for non positive semidefinite kernel functions and for several , possibly competing , performance criteria . track learning classifier systems and other genetics

compression in sorting algorithms . while , in general , any algorithm might benefit from compressed data because of reduced paging requirements , we identified two natural candidates that would further benefit from order preserving compression , namely string oriented sorting algorithms and word ram algorithms for keys of bounded length . the word ram model has some of the fastest known sorting algorithms in practice . these algorithms are designed for keys of bounded length , usually <digit> or <digit> bits , which limits their direct applicability for strings . one possibility is to use an order preserving compression scheme , so that a bounded key length algorithm can be applied . for the case of standard algorithms , we took what is considered to be the among the fastest nonword ram string sorting algorithms , fast <unk> , and measured its performance on compressed data . the fast <unk> algorithm of bentley and sedgewick is optimized to handle text strings . our experiments show that order compression techniques results in savings of approximately <digit> % over the same algorithm on noncompressed data . for the word ram , we modified andersson ' s sorting algorithm to handle variable length keys . the resulting algorithm is faster than the standard unix sort by a factor of <digit> . 5x . last , we used an order preserving scheme that is within a
