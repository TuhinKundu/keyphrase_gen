[sep] efficient discovery of grid services is essential for the success of grid computing. the standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids even though uddi has been the de facto industry standard for web services discovery, imposed requirements of tight replication among registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage. with the advent of grid computing the scalability issue of uddi will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids. in this paper we present our distributed web service discovery architecture, called dude ( distributed uddi deployment engine ). dude leverages dht ( distributed hash tables ) as a rendezvous mechanism between multiple uddi registries. dude enables consumers to query multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries.. based on preliminary prototype on planetlab, we believe that dude architecture can support effective distribution of uddi registries thereby making uddi more robust and also addressing its scaling issues. furthermore, the dude architecture for scalable distribution can be applied beyond uddi to any grid service discovery mechanism. categories and subject descriptors c2.

[sep] grids are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. one important problem in grid computing is resource selection, that is, finding an appropriate resource set for the application. another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid environment. existing solutions to these two problems require that a performance model for an application is known. however, constructing such models is a complex task. in this paper, we investigate an approach that does not require performance models. we start an application on any set of resources. during the application run, we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and deduce application requirements from these statistics. then, we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs. this approach allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded wan links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant performance improvements. we evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the grid. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] best effort packet switched networks, like the internet, do not offer a reliable transmission of packets to applications with real time constraints such as voice. thus, the loss of packets impairs the application level utility. for voice this utility impairment is twofold on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted. on the other hand, some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets. we first develop an end to end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow. these packet level metrics are then linked to user level objective speech quality metrics. using this framework, we find that for low compressing sample based codecs ( pcm ) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact. for high compressing frame based codecs ( g. [digit] ) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. contrary to sample based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however. we then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss. we designate these methods as intra flow loss recovery and control. at the end to end level, identification of packets sensitive to loss ( sender ) as well as loss concealment ( receiver ) takes place. hop by hop support schemes then allow to ( statistically ) trade the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance. as both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission, a gain in user perception is obtainable. we show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] the convergence of advances in storage, encoding, and networking technologies has brought us to an environment where huge amounts of continuous media content is routinely stored and exchanged between network enabled devices. keeping track of ( or managing ) such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data. storing live continuous media ( such as tv or radio content ) adds to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with. networked storage allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection to in fact be distributed across a network, making the task of content management all but impossible to deal with without a content management system. in this paper we present the design and implementation of the spectrum content management system, which deals with rich media content effectively in this environment. spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application to both stand alone and various networked scenarios. a unique aspect of spectrum is that it requires one ( or more ) retention policies to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system. this means that there are no eviction policies. content that no longer has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the system. different retention policies can easily be applied to the same content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication. this approach also allows spectrum to easily apply time based policies which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of live continuous media, to content. we not only describe the details of the spectrum architecture but also give typical use cases. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] operational transformation ( ot ) is a technique for consistency maintenance and group undo, and is being applied to an increasing number of collaborative applications. the theoretical foundation for ot is crucial in determining its capability to solve existing and new problems, as well as the quality of those solutions. the theory of causality has been the foundation of all prior ot systems, but it is inadequate to capture essential correctness requirements. past research had invented various patches to work around this problem, resulting in increasingly intricate and complicated ot algorithms. after having designed, implemented, and experimented with a series of ot algorithms, we reflected on what had been learned and set out to develop a new theoretical framework for better understanding and resolving ot problems, reducing its complexity, and supporting its continual evolution. in this paper, we report the main results of this effort the theory of operation context and the cot ( context based ot ) algorithm. the cot algorithm is capable of supporting both do and undo of any operations at anytime, without requiring transformation functions to preserve reversibility property, convergence property [digit], inverse properties [digit] and [digit]. the cot algorithm is not only simpler and more efficient than prior ot control algorithms, but also simplifies the design of transformation functions. we have implemented the cot algorithm in a generic collaboration engine and used it for supporting a range of novel collaborative applications. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] in recent years, overlay networks have become an effective alternative to ip multicast for efficient point to multipoint communication across the internet. typically, nodes self organize with the goal of forming an efficient overlay tree, one that meets performance targets without placing undue burden on the underlying network. in this paper, we target high bandwidth data distribution from a single source to a large number of receivers. applications include large file transfers and real time multimedia streaming. for these applications, we argue that an overlay mesh, rather than a tree, can deliver fundamentally higher bandwidth and reliability relative to typical tree structures. this paper presents bullet, a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes spread across the internet to self organize into a high bandwidth overlay mesh. we construct bullet around the insight that data should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in the network. individual bullet receivers are then responsible for locating and retrieving the data from multiple points in parallel. key contributions of this work include i ) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally likely to appear at any node, ii ) a scalable and decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover missing data items, and iii ) a complete implementation and evaluation of bullet running across the internet and in a large scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth improvements under a variety of circumstances. in addition, we find that, relative to tree based solutions, bullet reduces the need to perform expensive bandwidth probing. in a tree, it is critical that a node s parent delivers a high rate of application data to each child. in bullet however, nodes simultaneously receive data from multiple sources in parallel, making it less important to locate any single source capable of sustaining a high transmission rate. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] newly emerging game based application systems such as second provide 3d virtual environments where multiple users interact with each other in real time. they are filled with autonomous, mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users. to make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible, they are usually built on a client server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub worlds. in each sub world, the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint, rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium. in such systems, the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user s viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability. specifically, performing real time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub millions of active users are moving and interacting. we recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query. unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments. the main goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable real time visibility determination. we then uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality, system throughput, and resource utilization. we expect our approach to lay the groundwork for next generation virtual frameworks that may merge into existing web based services in the near future. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] topic detection and tracking [digit] and topic segmentation [digit] play an important role in capturing the local and sequential information of documents. previous work in this area usually focuses on single documents, although similar multiple documents are available in many domains. in this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised method for shared topic detection and topic segmentation of multiple similar documents based on mutual information ( mi ) and weighted mutual information ( wmi ) that is a combination of mi and term weights. the basic idea is that the optimal segmentation maximizes mi ( or wmi ). our approach can detect shared topics among documents. it can find the optimal boundaries in a document, and align segments among documents at the same time. it also can handle single document segmentation as a special case of the multi document segmentation and alignment. our methods can identify and strengthen cue terms that can be used for segmentation and partially remove stop words by using term weights based on entropy learned from multiple documents. our experimental results show that our algorithm works well for the tasks of single document segmentation, shared topic detection, and multi document segmentation. utilizing information from multiple documents can tremendously improve the performance of topic segmentation, and using wmi is even better than using mi for the multi document segmentation. categories and subject descriptors h.

[sep] the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions is the problem of determining the allocation of the items among the bidders that maximizes the sum of the accepted bid prices. while this problem is in general nphard, it is known to be feasible in polynomial time on those instances whose associated item graphs have bounded treewidth ( called structured item graphs ). formally, an item graph is a graph whose nodes are in one to one correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any bid, the items occurring in it induce a connected subgraph. note that many item graphs might be associated with a given combinatorial auction, depending on the edges selected for guaranteeing the connectedness. in fact, the tractability of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed treewidth exists ( and if so, computing one ) was left as a crucial open problem. in this paper, we solve this problem by proving that the existence of a structured item graph is computationally intractable, even for treewidth [digit]. motivated by this bad news, we investigate different kinds of structural requirements that can be used to isolate tractable classes of combinatorial auctions. we show that the notion of hypertree decomposition, a recently introduced measure of hypergraph cyclicity, turns out to be most useful here. indeed, we show that the winner determination problem is solvable in polynomial time on instances whose bidder interactions can be represented with ( dual ) hypergraphs having bounded hypertree width. even more surprisingly, we show that the class of tractable instances identified by means of our approach properly contains the class of instances having a structured item graph. categories and subject descriptors j.
