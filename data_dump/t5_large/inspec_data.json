frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference ( isi ) always occurs . the

unseen but similar grammars . the neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars . analysis of the state space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings . these representations are context sensitive , hierarchical , and based on the state variable of the finite state machines that the neural network has learned . generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network , allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network . the results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation ( such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system ) can not in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology", "streaming , disruptive interference and power law behavior in the exit dynamics . <sep> we analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a room . pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time . a pedestrian could move forward , backward , left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors . the arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes . power law behavior is found in the burst size frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension ( w > <digit> ) . the slope of the power law curve varies with w from <digit> . <digit> ( w <digit> ) to <digit> . <digit> ( w <digit> ) . streaming which is a diffusive behavior , arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single exit room with w <digit> and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput q is obtained that is higher than with w <digit> , <digit> , or <digit> . for a two exit room ( w <digit> ) , q is not greater than twice the yield of a single exit room . if the doors are not separated far enough ( < 4w ) , q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slow down that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each other ' s path ( disruptive

fluctuations in one of the quadrature components of the combined field in this system . we demonstrate that efficient and lasting higher order squeezing effects could be observed with proper choice of the relative phase between the pump and coherent fields . this nonclassical feature is attributed to a constructive two photon interference . relationship between the second and higher order squeezing of the field is discussed", "modeling self consistent multi class dynamic traffic flow . <sep> traffic model derived from the vehicular boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model . the multilane domain is considered as a two dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model . the reason we consider a multilane domain as a two dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes , especially motorcyclists . the dispersion model , which is a nonlinear poisson equation , is derived from the car following theory and the equilibrium assumption . under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section , the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model . in addition , the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas kinetic model derived from the boltzmann equation . multiplying boltzmann equation by the zeroth , first and second order moment functions , integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules , we can derive continuity , motion and variance equation , respectively . however , the second order moment function , which is the square of the individual velocity , is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow", "mixture of experts classification using a hierarchical

and specialty brokers . businesses that pioneered internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels . as such , web sites replace the traditional trading model to the internet . web enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster , less costly , highly reliable , and secure . auction based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier centric to market centric and transforming the trading model from one to many to many to many . historically , pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit . traditionally , as products and services move through the supply chain , from the producer to the consumer , various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price . as internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent , traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing . a dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product , but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction . many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins , despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing . the future of such endeavors remains promising , but controversial", "affine invariants of convex polygons . <sep> registration and object recognition , proposed recently by yang and cohen ( see ibid . , vol .

efficiency . this paper deals with the real time implementation of spiht algorithm using dsp chip . in order to facilitate the implementation and improve the codec ' s performance , some relative issues are thoroughly discussed , such as the optimization of program structure to speed up the wavelet decomposition . spiht ' s high memory requirement is a major drawback for hardware implementation . in this paper , we modify the original spiht algorithm by presenting two new concepts number of error bits and absolute zerotree . consequently , the memory cost is significantly reduced . we also introduce a new method to control the coding process by number of error bits . our experimental results show that the implementation meets common requirement of real time video coding and is proven to be a practical and efficient dsp solution", "efficient computation of local geometric moments . <sep> as edge detection and texture segmentation . the main reason for this is that they are inherently integral based features , so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise . the computation of local moments , when viewed as a neighborhood operation , can be interpreted as a convolution of the image with a set of masks . nevertheless , moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account . by introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments , this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple", "adaptive image denoising using scale and space consistency . <sep> based on image multiresolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform . in our approach , edges are implicitly located and preserved in the wavelet domain , whilst image noise is filtered out . at each resolution level , the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes ( obtained from the wavelet coefficients ) , which are modeled probabilistically , and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained . joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges . the shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions , and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated . the proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image , where homogeneous regions appear separated by well defined edges . possible applications include image presegmentation , and image denoising", "tracking nonparameterized object contours in video . <sep> transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection . using the concept of topographical distance , the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization . this new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces . in particular , our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour , predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame . we also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account . the compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background . the experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches", "multilayered image representation application to image compression . <sep> and image compression . we describe a new multilayered representation technique for images . an image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers piecewise smooth regions layer , textures layer , etc . the multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions . during each iteration of the algorithm , we code the residual part in a lossy way we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part , which results in a sparse representation . each layer is encoded independently with a different transform , or basis , at a different bitrate , and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way . the strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data , while others will catch the local transients , or the oscillatory patterns . this multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding , and image and video coding . we have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities", "combining spatial and scale space techniques for edge detection to provide a . <sep> new methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale space domains are proposed . a priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge . an improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering . probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes , gradient phases and edge connectivity . the scale space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales . a probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale space domain methods . decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale . these matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion . the spatially adaptive wavelet noise filtering algorithm is qualitatively and

processing . <sep> the primary part of the mammalian auditory system using a stochastic fitzhugh nagumo model and an action recovery model for synaptic depression . our overall model covers the chain from a hair cell to a point just after the synaptic connection with a cell in the cochlear nucleus . the information processing performance of the system is evaluated using so called phi divergences from statistics that quantify dissimilarity between probability measures and are intimately related to a number of fundamental limits in statistics and information theory ( it ) . we show that there exists a set of parameters that can optimize several important phi divergences simultaneously and that this set corresponds to a constant quiescent firing rate ( qfr ) of the spiral ganglion neuron . the optimal value of the qfr is frequency dependent but is essentially independent of the amplitude of the signal ( for small amplitudes ) . consequently , optimal processing according to several

for pixel based image segmentation . often , different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade off between uncertainty ( variance ) and location accuracy . the optimal set of scales depends on several factors the noise level present in the image material , the prior distribution of the different types of segments , the class conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the ( connected ) segments . we analyse , theoretically and through experiments , the possibility of using the overall and class conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces . it is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account . however , a uniform ( ignorant ) prior distribution ensures constant class conditional error rates . consequently , we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted , scale invariant segmentation approach is desired . experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance ( mr ) images , acquired with a paramagnetic tracer , support the theoretical results . furthermore , the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier , extracted from the linear

within the mpeg <digit> evaluation framework . as a result , it has been selected for inclusion in the mpeg <digit> package of standards", "restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquid crystal optical phased . <sep> in many imaging applications , it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beam steering components ( i . e . , mirrors and gimbals ) with a nonmechanical device . one such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array ( lcopa ) . an lcopa can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light . however , when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system , two adverse effects can occur . first , dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles , causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane . second , the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order , but to others as well . this multiple order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane . we describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations . the proposed postprocessing technique is based on a wiener deconvolution filter . the technique , however , is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest . experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique", "one step digit set restricted modified signed digit adder using an incoherent . <sep> an efficient one step digit set restricted modified signed digit ( msd ) adder based on symbolic substitution is presented . in this technique , carry propagation is avoided by introducing reference digits to restrict the intermediate carry and sum digits to <digit> , <digit> and <digit> , <digit> , respectively . the proposed technique requires significantly fewer minterms and simplifies system complexity compared to the reported one step msd addition techniques . an incoherent correlator based on an optoelectronic shared content addressable memory processor is suggested to perform the addition operation . in this technique , only one set of minterms needs to be stored , independent of the operand length", "two step integral imaging for orthoscopic three dimensional imaging with . <sep> we present a two step integral imaging system to obtain <digit> d orthoscopic real images . by adopting a nonstationary micro optics technique , we demonstrate experimentally the potential usefulness of two step integral imaging", "diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures . <sep> a mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras , coded imaging systems , optical information processing , etc . because of its high resolution , its infinite depth of focus , and its usefulness over a broad frequency spectra ranging from visible light to x rays and gamma rays . while the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far field diffraction , they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration . therefore the derivation of the far field diffraction for a single aperture can not be applied to a mask with periodic apertures . the far field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past , the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design . we study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it . first , the near field diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of lommel ' s function . then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together , and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution , blurring aberration , and the criterion of defining the far or near field diffraction . this concept can also be expanded to analyze different types of masks with the arbitrarily shaped apertures", "binocular model for figure ground segmentation in translucent and occluding . <sep> a fourier based solution to the problem of figure ground segmentation in short baseline binocular image pairs is presented . each image is modeled as an additive composite of two component images that exhibit a spatial shift due to the binocular parallax . the segmentation is accomplished by decoupling each fourier component in one of the resultant additive images into its two constituent phasors , allocating each to its appropriate object specific spectrum , and then reconstructing the foreground and background using the inverse fourier transform . it is shown that the foreground and background shifts can be computed from the differences of the magnitudes and phases of the fourier transform of the binocular image pair . while the model is based on translucent objects , it also works with occluding objects", "multispectral color image capture using a liquid crystal tunable filter . <sep> system consisting of a professional monochrome ccd camera and a tunable filter in which the spectral transmittance can be controlled electronically . we perform a spectral characterization of the acquisition system taking into account the acquisition noise . to convert the camera output signals to device independent color data , two main approaches are proposed and evaluated . one consists in applying regression methods to convert from the k camera outputs to a device independent color space such as ciexyz or cielab . another method is based on a spectral model of the acquisition system . by inverting the model using a principal eigenvector approach , we estimate the spectral reflectance of each pixel of the imaged surface", "iterative regularized least mean mixed norm image restoration . <sep> various types of noise . a mixed norm functional is introduced , which combines the least mean square ( lms ) and the least mean fourth ( lmf ) functionals , as well as a smoothing functional . two regularization parameters are introduced one to determine the relative importance of the lms and lmf functionals , which is a function of the kurtosis , and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional . the two parameters are chosen in such a way that the proposed functional is convex , so that a unique minimizer exists . an iterative algorithm is utilized for obtaining the solution , and its convergence is analyzed . the novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required , and the relative contributions of the lms , the lmf , and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image . experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm", "motion estimation using modified dynamic programming . <sep> moving objects in a sequence of images is proposed . correspondence vector field computation is formulated as a matching optimization problem for multiple dynamic images . the proposed method is a heuristic modification of dynamic programming applied to the <digit> d optimization problem . motion vector field estimates using real movie images demonstrate good performance of the algorithm in terms of dynamic motion analysis", "centroid detection based on optical correlation . <sep> centroids of multiple objects in an input scene . the first method is based on the modulus of the moment function , the second method is based on squaring the moment function , and the third method works with a single intensity filter . these methods are invariant to changes in the position , orientation , and scale of the object and result in good noise smoothing performance . we use spatial light modulators ( slms ) to directly implement the input of the image and filter information for the purpose of these approaches . we present results showing simulations from different approaches and provide comparisons between optical correlation and digital moment based methods . experimental results corresponding to an optical correlator using slms for the centroid detection are also presented", "block truncation image bit plane coding . <sep> to its simple and fast computational burden . the bit rate is fixed to <digit> . <digit> bits pixel , whose performance is moderate in terms of compression ratio compared to other compression schemes such as discrete cosine transform ( dct ) , vector quantization ( vq ) , wavelet transform coding ( wtc ) , etc . two kinds of overheads are required for btc coding bit plane and quantization values , respectively . a new technique is presented to reduce the bit plane overhead . conventional bit plane overhead is <digit> . <digit> bits pixel we decrease it to <digit> . <digit> bits pixel while maintaining the same decoded quality as absolute moment btc ( ambtc ) does for the lena image . compared to other published bit plane coding strategies , the proposed method outperforms all of the existing methods", "plenoptic image editing . <sep> designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3d scene . the distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the ( unknown ) 3d scene had itself been modified . the modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations . the approach is useful first as a power assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few , and second as a means for constructing and editing image based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs . the approach works by extending operations like image painting , scissoring , and morphing so that they alter a scene ' s plenoptic function in a physically consistent way , thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously . a key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scene ' s plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints", "elimination of zero order diffraction in digital holography . <sep> image of digital holography is presented . in this method , the laplacian of a detected hologram is used instead of the hologram itself for numerical reconstruction by computing the discrete fresnel integral . this method can significantly improve the image quality and give better resolution and higher accuracy of the reconstructed image

and . <sep> an efficient method for two level thresholding is proposed based on the bayes formula and the maximum entropy principle , in which no assumptions of the image histogram are made . an alternative criterion is derived based on maximizing entropy and used for speeding up the searching algorithm . five forms of conditional probability distributions simple , linear , parabola concave , parabola convex , and s function are employed and compared to each other for optimal threshold determination . the effect of precision on optimal threshold determination is discussed and a trade off precision epsilon <digit> . <digit> is selected experimentally . our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in speed from <digit> to <digit> times faster

model and a fuzzy logic technique . the fuzzy logic approach is employed to obtain the different strengths and lengths of a watermark by the local characteristics of the image in our proposed scheme . in our experiments , this scheme provides a more robust and imperceptible watermark", "optical encoding of color three dimensional correlation . <sep> distribution as the third dimension , has been shown to be useful for color pattern recognition tasks . nevertheless , 3d correlation can not be directly performed on an optical correlator , that can only process two dimensional ( 2d ) signals . we propose a method to encode 3d functions onto 2d ones in such a way that the fourier transform and correlation of these signals , that can be optically performed , encode the 3d fourier transform and correlation of the 3d signals . the theory for the encoding is given and experimental results obtained in an optical correlator are shown", "search for efficient solutions of multi criterion problems by target level . <sep> the target level method is considered for solving continuous multi criterion maximization problems . in the first step , the decision maker specifies a target level point ( the desired criterion values ) then in the set of vector evaluations we seek points that are closest to the target point in the chebyshev metric . the vector evaluations obtained in this way are in general weakly efficient . to identify the efficient evaluations , the second step maximizes the sum of the criteria on the set generated in step <digit> . we prove the relationship between the

presidential campaign . <sep> we consider the behavior of four choice rules plurality voting , approval voting , borda count , and self consistent choice when applied to choose the best option from a three element set . it is assumed that the two main options are preferred by a large majority of the voters , while the third option gets a very small number of votes and influences the election outcome only when the two main options receive a close number of votes . when used to rate the main options , borda count and self consistent choice contain terms that allow both for the strength of preferences of the voters and the rating of the main candidates by voters who vote for the third option . in this way , it becomes possible to determine more reliably the winner when plurality voting or approval voting produce close results", "an inverse problem for a model of a hierarchical structure . <sep> parabolic equation . the model is applied to describe the functioning of a hierarchical structure it is also relevant for heat conduction theory . unique solvability of the inverse problem is proved", "self calibration from image derivatives . <sep> from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters , where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole camera model . the equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters . a set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow , and from these parameters the calibration can be determined . however , as for discrete motion , in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components . geometrically , the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component , and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation . in general , for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary , with the 3d rotation changing between the measurements . the geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements . new constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives , and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated . the calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields . as the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks , or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases", "inverse problems for a mathematical model of ion exchange in a compressible ion . <sep> a mathematical model of ion exchange is

by computer . <sep> the algorithmic complexity of the innermost loops that determine the complexity of algorithms in computational electromagnetics ( cem ) codes are analyzed according to their operation count and the impact of the underlying computer hardware . as memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors , codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower . hence , matrix matrix multiplications are much faster than matrix vector multiplications . it is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity , but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution . implications involve fdtd loops , lu factorizations , and iterative solvers for dense matrices . run

living instead in a world where problems are ill defined , data is scarce , time is short , politics is dominant , and rational decision makers are non existent . the root cause of the profession ' s

tomography ( ct ) images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing . we have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation , the polyenergetic spectrum , and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms conventional filtered backprojection ( fbp ) , deterministic iterative deblurring , and a new iterative algorithm , alternating minimization ( am ) , based on a ct detector model that includes noise , scatter , and polyenergetic spectra . contrary to the dominant view of the literature , fbp streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between fbp ' s simplified model of ct detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition . artifacts on am images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector model mismatches . however , metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient , including its pose , shape , and attenuation map , are used to constrain am ' s iterations . am image reconstruction , in combination with object constrained ct to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient , is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility", "matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck area development of method and . <sep> positron emission tomography ( pet ) provides important information on tumor biology , but lacks detailed anatomical information . our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck . three difficulties in achieving this goal are ( <digit> ) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations ( <digit> ) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and ( <digit> ) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results . these problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask . the proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan . to obtain sufficient ( anatomical ) information for matching , two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol . a mutual information based algorithm was used as a registration technique . pet and ct data were obtained in seven patients . each patient had two ct scans and one pet scan . the datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching pet to ct sub <digit> , ct sub <digit> to ct sub <digit> , and ct sub <digit> to pet using the full circle consistency test . it was found that using our method , consistency could be obtained of <digit> mm and <digit> . <digit> degrees on average . the pet voxels used for registration were <digit> . <digit> mm , so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size . cropping the images ( removing the scanner bed from images ) did not improve the consistency of the algorithm . the transmission scan , however , could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach . in conclusion , the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view , it is a user independent , automatic validation

of an enzyme catalysed reaction system . <sep> reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics . recently , it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of loss of system coordination ( liu , <digit> ) . in this paper , we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme mediated reactions . we show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities . in particular , we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses a unique , globally stable steady state , large amplitude oscillations , and asymptotically unbounded solutions , with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous . it is shown that the appearance of large amplitude , stable limit cycles occurs due to a false bifurcation or canard explosion . the subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow , namely , a saddle connection . subsequently , almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination . we discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems", "a spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in southern africa . <sep> set of spatial units in areas where long term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only . the work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of zimbabwe , which includes a crop production component for yields of maize , small grains and groundnuts . only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records . preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra seasonal temporal correlation was negligible , but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations . this spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of <digit> related variables , representing dekadly rainfall in each of the <digit> wards . for each ward , log transformed rainfall for each of the <digit> dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation , which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations . a covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards . sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad . cross validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well . the methodology developed is useful in situations where long term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation , but negligible temporal correlation", "an algorithm

"discrete output feedback sliding mode control of second order systems a moving switching line approach . <sep> designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase . for second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line . in this paper , we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control . the main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller . and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase . simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback", "when a better interface and easy navigation aren ' t enough examining the . <sep> an information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system . but usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation . in this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency . one system is a legacy , text based system with cumbersome navigation ( rms ) the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation ( copnet ) . it is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate copnet higher than rms , but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will . we conducted two user studies . one study examined what users thought of rms and copnet , and compared rms experts ' evaluations with nonexperts . we found that all users evaluated copnet as more effective , easier to use , and easier to navigate than rms , and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system . the second , follow up study examined use behavior after copnet was deployed some time later . the findings revealed that evaluations of copnet were not associated with its use . if the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older , legacy system , why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch we discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult , especially for those who are most adept at using the older system . implications for system design and usability are also discussed", "optimization of planning an advertising campaign of goods and

article examines how the internet transforms collective action . current practices on the web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational , individual to collective , undertakings . even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the internet ' s powers of mass communication , which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the web . theoretically , collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement . empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike . however , the internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements . perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the internet", "explanations for the perpetration of and reactions to deception in a virtual . <sep> cases of identity deception on the internet are not uncommon . several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media . the authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals . in this case , an established community member ( df ) invented a character ( nowheremom ) whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident . when other members of the community eventually began to question nowheremom ' s actual identity , df admitted that he invented her . the discussion board was flooded with reactions to df ' s revelation . the authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception , including psychiatric illness , identity play , and expressions of true self . they also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations ( social identity , deviance , and norm violation ) to account for their reactions . it is argued that virtual communities ' reactions to such threatening events provide invaluable clues for the study of group processes on the internet", "the effects

in the form of a thin layer with small scale stratification and fast time modulation of parameters . algorithms for space time modulation of the controlled layer structure are studied in detail for a

of the considered algorithms of parametric control transform the low frequency incident wave to high frequency waves of the technological band for which the waveguiding medium inside the layer is assumed to be opaque ( absorbing ) . the efficient use conditions are found for all the algorithms . it is shown that the absorbing layer can be as thin as desired with respect to the minimum spatial scale of the incident wave and ensures efficient absorption in a wide frequency interval ( starting from zero frequency ) that is bounded from above only by a finite space time resolution of the parameter control operations . the structure of a three dimensional parametric ' black coating whose efficiency is independent of the angle of incidence of an incoming wave is developed on the basis of the studied one dimensional problems . the general solution of the problem of diffraction of incident waves from such a coating is obtained . this solution is analyzed in detail for the case of a

property correlation . neural networks are inherently unstable , in that small changes in the training set and or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance . recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models , ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors . in this work , we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation , or bagging , as applied to qsar and qspr . although aggregation does offer definitive advantages , we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results . these findings are rationalized using krogh and vedelsby ' s ( <digit> ) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them . for networks that are designed to resist over fitting , the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming", "median partitioning a novel method for

for subset selection , the mp approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections . the only time limiting step is the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds . mp employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected . in each of n subsequent steps , a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of <digit> sup n partitions are obtained . for descriptor evaluation and selection , an entropy formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm . mp has been applied to generate a subset of the available

for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved . to compare properties across different data sets , a common scale must be defined . using several publicly available databases ( acd , cmc , mddr , and nci ) as a basis , we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors . these chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages . first , it is possible to define chemically relevant scales , greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets . second , this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces . for example , descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with

<sep> the pls variant of the mtd method ( t . i . oprea et al . , sar qsar environ . res . <digit> , <digit> , <digit> <digit> ) was applied to a series of <digit> acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis substrates . statistically significant mtd pls models ( q sup <digit> between <digit> . <digit> and <digit> . <digit> ) are in agreement with previous mtd models , with the advantage that local contributions are understood beyond the occupancy nonoccupancy interpretation in mtd . a chemically intuitive approach further forces mtd pls coefficients to assume only negative ( or zero ) values for fragmental volume descriptors and positive ( or zero ) values for fragmental hydrophobicity descriptors . this further separates the various kinds of local interactions at each vertex of the mtd hypermolecule , making this method suitable for medicinal chemistry synthesis planning", "prediction of ultraviolet spectral absorbance using quantitative . <sep> high performance liquid

. <sep> partial order theory ( pot ) is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds , based on selected structural and or electronic descriptors ( modeled order ) , or based on their end points , e . g . , solubility ( experimental order ) . if the modeled order resembles the experimental order , compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the model that eventually might lead to a prediction of an end point value . however , in the application of pot in quantitative structure activity relationship modeling , only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied . to explore the possibilities of improving the methodology , the theory is extended by application of the so called linear extensions of the model order . the study show that partial ordering combined with linear extensions appears as a promising tool providing probability distribution curves in the range of possible end point values for compounds not being experimentally investigated", "novel ze isomerism descriptors derived from molecular topology and their . <sep> we introduce several series of novel ze isomerism descriptors derived directly from two dimensional molecular topology . these descriptors make use of a quantity named ze isomerism correction , which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected

that multimedia presentations should be superior to text only and text with static pictures in facilitating optimal human information processing and , therefore , comprehension . the article reports the findings from a <digit> ( text only , overhead slides , and multimedia presentation ) <digit> ( high and low information complexity ) factorial experiment . subjects read a text script , viewed an

explain . the article gives a first attempt to this by as suming two simple lotka laws ( with exponent <digit> ) one for the number of authors with n papers ( total count here ) and one for the number of papers with n authors , n in n . based on an earlier made convolution model of egghe , interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores , we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter , which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by rao ( <digit> ) . the article also shows that (

method . <sep> systems is often called digital democracy . such an approach implies the utilization of the majority opinion of internet users to determine the most relevant documents for example , citation index usage for sorting of search results ( google . com ) or an enrichment of a query with terms that are asked frequently in relation with the query ' s theme . digital democracy is an effective instrument in many cases , but it has an unavoidable shortcoming , which is a matter of principle the average intellectual and cultural level of internet users is very low everyone knows what kind of information is dominant in internet query statistics . therefore , when one searches the internet by means of digital democracy systems , one gets answers that reflect an underlying assumption that the user ' s mind potential is very low , and that his cultural interests are not demanding . thus , it is more correct to use the term digital ochlocracy to refer to internet search systems with digital democracy . based on the well known mathematical mechanism of linear programming , we propose a method to solve the indicated problem", "note on deterministic inventory lot size

settings of variables , such as sample size , inspection frequency , and termination time for each run , which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost . assuming that the product ' s degradation paths satisfy wiener processes , this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem . first , an identification rule is proposed .

from a manufacturer ' s point of view . these servicing strategies represent a renewable free replacement , nonrenewable free replacement , renewable pro rata , and a nonrenewable minimal repair warranty plans . the results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product . furthermore , using a normal

<sep> much discussion has taken place over the relative merits of various platforms and operating systems for real time data collection . most would agree that , provided great care is taken , many are capable of millisecond timing precision . however , to date , much of this work has focused on the theoretical aspects of raw performance . it is our belief that researchers would be better informed if they could place confidence limits on their own specific paradigms in situ and without modification . to this end , we have developed a millisecond precision test rig that can control and

experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probability learning paradigm . previous research reported that people tested via the web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced . the optimal strategy , however , is to consistently choose the more frequent event probability matching produces suboptimal performance . we investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance . a horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously . ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice , including all combinations of ( <digit> ) explicit

based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis ( lsa ) . students were given self explanation reading training ( sert ) , which teaches strategies that facilitate self explanation during reading , such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences . during a computerized version of sert practice , students read texts and typed self explanations into a computer after each sentence . the use of sert strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self explanations . this assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and lsa . both human judgments and lsa were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with sert tended to paraphrase the text sentences , whereas students who were compliant with sert tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context . the similarity between human judgments and lsa indicates that lsa will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a web based

biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach . second , a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot . many choices , tuning

leading to a nonlinear problem formulation . the gauss newton approach is one of the standard mathematical tools capable of solving this kind of problem . to our experience , this algorithm has specific drawbacks which are caused by the applied regularization procedure . in particular , under clinical conditions the amount of regularization can not be determined clearly . for this reason , we have developed an iterative algorithm solving this nonlinear problem by a sequence of regularized linear problems . at each step of iteration , an individual l curve is computed . subsequent

different source and noise settings two sources which are close or distant and noise which is uncorrelated or correlated . the commonly used msp residual variance is seen to be ineffective , that is it often selects too many sources . alternatives like the adjusted hotelling ' s test , bayes information criterion and the wald test on source amplitudes are seen to be effective . the adjusted

desirable . the msps are applied to empirical data ( visual evoked fields )", "time varying properties of renal autoregulatory mechanisms . <sep> autoregulation , time frequency and time scaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broad band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and single nephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive ( sprague dawley , wistar , and long evans ) rats , and spontaneously hypertensive rats . time frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback ( tgf ) mechanisms have time varying characteristics . furthermore , we utilized the renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood flow dynamics in the time frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings . we found a clear difference in renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced ( p < <digit> . <digit> ) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations ( p < <digit> . <digit> ) , and at the single nephron level ( p < <digit> . <digit> ) . especially at the single nephron level , the mean renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats , suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition . to further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms , we employed multiresolution wavelet transform . our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms , the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats . the separation of the scales at the myogenic and tgf frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with <digit> % accuracy . however , this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressure flow data . the results suggest that understanding of the time varying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation", "the use of the spsa method in ecg analysis . <sep> signals recorded

changes in qrs during arrythmias , t wave alternants , or the study of drug effects on ventricular activation . we propose to apply a modification of a classical method of cluster analysis or vector

the new class distortion measure is much more sensitive to outliers than the usual distortion measures using average distance . the price of this practical advantage is that computational complexity

modern molecular methods , development of a quantitative theory has not kept pace with this increase in observing power . this is in part due to the complexity of the system and to the lack of

nonuniform transmission lines by using differential . <sep> this paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique , called the differential quadrature method ( dqm ) , which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines . the dqm can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain . using the dqm , the frequency domain telegrapher ' s partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations . dqm reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain . although the rationalization process in dqm is comparable with the pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation ( awe ) applied to transmission lines , the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different . unlike awe , which employs a complex moment matching process to obtain rational approximation , the dqm requires no approximation of transcendental functions , thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching . due to global sampling of points in the dqm approximation , it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do . the dqm based time domain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like spice", "an unconditionally stable

under closed loop . <sep> this paper proposes a new method for obtaining a linear quadratic gaussian ( lqg ) benchmark in terms of the variances of process input and output from closed loop data , for assessing the controller performance . lqg benchmark has been proposed in the literature to assess controller performance since the lqg tradeoff curve represents the limit of performance in terms of input and output variances . however , an explicit parametric model is required to calculate the lqg benchmark . in this work , we propose a data driven subspace approach to calculate the lqg benchmark under closed loop conditions with certain external excitations . the optimal lqg benchmark variances are obtained directly from the subspace matrices corresponding to the deterministic inputs and the stochastic inputs , which are identified using closed loop data with setpoint excitation . these variances are used for assessing the controller performance . the method proposed in this paper is applicable to both univariate and multivariate systems . profit analysis for the implementation of feedforward control to the existing feedback only control system is also analyzed under the optimal lqg performance framework", "lossy spice models produce realistic averaged simulations . <sep> waveforms analysis were usually applied over perfect elements , non inclusive of the ohmic
