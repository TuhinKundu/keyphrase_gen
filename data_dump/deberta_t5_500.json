"definition and recognition of rib features in aircraft structural part . <sep> in this research , a new type of manufacturing feature that is commonly observed in aircraft structural parts , known as ribs , is defined and implemented using the object oriented software engineering approach . the rib feature type is defined as a set of constrained and adjacent faces of a part which are associated with a set of specific rib machining operations . computerized numerical control ( cnc ) operation experience and the machining knowledge are leveraged by analysing typical geometry interactions when generating machining tool paths where such knowledge and experience are abstracted as rules of process planning . then those abstracted machining process rules are implemented in a feature recognition algorithm on top of an existing and holistic attribute adjacency graph solution to extract seed faces , identify individual local rib elements and further cluster these newly identified local rib elements into groups for the ease of machining operations . out of the potentially different combinations of local rib elements , those optimised cluster groups are merged into the top level rib

constraint . <sep> a key step for managing a large video database is to partition the video sequences into shots . past approaches to this problem tend to confuse gradual shot changes with changes caused by smooth camera motions . this is in part due to the fact that camera motion has not been dealt with in a more fundamental way . we propose an approach that is based on a physical constraint used in optical flow analysis , namely , the total brightness of a scene point across two frames should remain constant if the change across two frames is a result of smooth camera motion . since the brightness constraint would be violated across a shot change , the detection can be based on detecting the violation of this constraint . it is robust because it uses only the qualitative aspect of the brightness constraint detecting a scene change rather than estimating the scene itself . moreover , by tapping on the significant know how in using this constraint , the algorithm 's robustness is further enhanced . experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of various algorithms . it was shown that our algorithm is less likely to interpret gradual camera motions as shot changes , resulting in a significantly better precision performance than most other algorithms .", "tail asymptotics for hol priority queues handling a large number of independent stationary sources . <sep> in this paper we study the asymptotics of the tail of the buffer occupancy distribution in buffers accessed by a large number of stationary independent sources and which are served according to a strict hol priority rule . as in the case of single buffers , the results are valid for a very general class of sources which include long range dependent sources with bounded instantaneous rates . we first consider the case of two buffers with one of them having strict priority over the other and we obtain asymptotic upper bound for the buffer tail probability for lower priority buffer . we discuss the conditions to have asymptotic equivalents . the asymptotics are studied in terms of a scaling parameter which reflects the server speed , buffer level and the number of sources in such a way that the ratios remain constant . the results are then generalized to the case of m buffers which leads to the source pooling idea . we conclude with numerical validation of our formulae against simulations which show that the asymptotic bounds are tight . we also show that the commonly suggested reduced service rate approximation can give extremely low estimates .", "a variant of parallel

optimization . <sep> in this paper we propose a method to use multiple generative models with latent variables for classification tasks . the standard approach to use generative models for classification is to train a separate model for each class . a novel data point is then classified by the model that attributes the highest probability . the algorithm we propose modifies the parameters of the models to improve the classification accuracy . our approach is made computationally tractable by assuming that each of the models is deterministic , by which we mean that a data point is associated to only a single latent state . the resulting algorithm is a variant of the support vector machine learning algorithm and in a limiting case the method is similar to the standard perceptron learning algorithm . we apply the method to two types of latent variable models . the first has a discrete latent state space and the second , principal component analysis , has a continuous latent state space . we compare the effectiveness of both approaches on a handwritten digit recognition problem and on a satellite image recognition problem .", "a framework for a real time

order independent information from online data . this information , which we term pseudo online , conveys relevant information on the offline representation of the word . based on this information , a combination of classification decisions from online and pseudo online cursive word recognizers is performed to improve the recognition of online cursive words . one of the most valuable aspects of this approach with respect to similar methods that combine online and offline classifiers for word recognition is that the pseudo online representation is similar to the online signal and , hence , word recognition is based on a single engine . results demonstrate that the pseudo online representation is useful as the combination of classifiers perform better than those based solely on pure

emphasized mobile telephony ( gsm ) , where gmsk signals are used , as well as the uwb communications , where short period pulses based on gaussian waveform are generated . since the gaussian function signifies a theoretical concept , which can not be accomplished from the physical point of view , this should be expressed by using various functions , able to determine physical implementations . new

support vector machines ( svms ) . to this end , a complete svm like framework of linear pca ( svpca ) for deciding the projection direction is constructed , where new expected risk and margin are introduced . within this framework , a new semi definite programming problem for maximizing the margin is formulated and a new definition of support vectors is established . as a weighted case of regular pca , our svpca coincides with the regular pca if all the samples play the same part in data compression . theoretical explanation indicates that svpca is based on a margin based generalization bound and thus good prediction ability is ensured . furthermore , the robust form of svpca with a interpretable parameter is achieved using the soft idea in svms . the great advantage lies in the fact that svpca is a learning algorithm without local minima because of the convexity of the semi definite optimization problems . to validate the performance of svpca , several experiments are conducted and numerical results have demonstrated that their generalization ability is better than that of regular pca . finally , some existing problems are also discussed .", "the neighborhood auditing tool a hybrid interface for auditing the umls . <sep> the umls 's integration of more than <digit> source vocabularies , not necessarily consistent with one another , causes some inconsistencies . the purpose of auditing the umls is to detect such inconsistencies and to suggest how to resolve them while observing the requirement of fully representing the content of each source in the umls . a software tool , called the neighborhood auditing tool ( nat ) , that facilitates umls auditing is presented . the nat supports neighborhood based auditing , where , at any given time , an auditor concentrates on a single focus concept and one of a variety of neighborhoods of its closely related concepts . typical diagrammatic displays of concept networks have a number of shortcomings , so the nat utilizes a hybrid diagram text interface that features stylized neighborhood views which retain some of the best features of both the diagrammatic layouts and text windows while avoiding the shortcomings . the nat allows an auditor to display knowledge from both the metathesaurus ( concept ) level and the semantic network ( semantic type ) level . various additional features of the nat that support the auditing process are described . the usefulness of the nat is demonstrated through a group of case studies . its impact is tested with a study involving a select group of auditors .

frequently have the difficulty that subboxes containing no solution can not be easily eliminated if they are close to the global minimum . this has the effect that near each global minimum , and in the process of solving the problem also near the currently best found local minimum , many small boxes are created by repeated splitting , whose processing often dominates the total work spent on the global search . this paper discusses the reasons for the occurrence of this so called cluster effect , and how to reduce the cluster effect by defining exclusion regions around each local minimum found , that are guaranteed to contain no other local minimum and hence can safely be discarded . in addition , we will introduce a method for verifying the existence of a feasible point close to an approximate local minimum . these exclusion regions are constructed using uniqueness tests based on the krawczyk operator and make use of first , second and third order information on the objective and constraint functions .", "learning about meetings . <sep> most people participate in meetings almost every day , multiple times a day . the study of meetings is important , but also challenging ,

structure . we demonstrate our approach to analyse the behaviour of various structures with spherical and cylindrical shapes , characteristic of downwind sails over a rather wide range of shape and constitutive parameters . in all cases convergence is reached and the overall flying shape is most adequately represented , which shows that our approach is a most valuable alternative to standard

dimensional ddg and constructs a one dimensional ( 1d ) schedule . based on the one dimensional schedule , the third step derives a simple mapping function that specifies the schedule time for the operation instances in the multidimensional loop . the classical modulo scheduling is subsumed by ssp as a special case . ssp is also closely related to hyperplane scheduling , and , in fact , extends it to be resource constrained . we prove that ssp schedules are correct and at least as efficient as those schedules generated by traditional modulo scheduling methods . we extend ssp to schedule imperfect loop nests , which are most common at the instruction level . multiple initiation intervals are naturally allowed to improve execution efficiency . feasibility and correctness of our approach are verified by a prototype implementation in the orc compiler for the ia <digit> architecture , tested with loop nests from livermore and spec2000 floating point benchmarks . preliminary experimental results reveal that , compared to modulo scheduling , software pipelining at an appropriate loop level results in significant performance improvement . software pipelining is beneficial even with prior loop transformations .", "a geometric based method for recognizing overlapping polygonal shaped and semi transparent particles in gray tone images . <sep> a geometric based method is proposed to recognize the overlapping particles of different polygonal shapes such as rectangular , regular and or irregular prismatic particles in a gray tone image . the first step consists in extracting the salient corners , identified by their locations and orientations , of the overlapping particles . although there are certain difficulties like the perspective geometric projection , out of focus , transparency and superposition of the studied particles . then , a new clustering technique is applied to detect the shape by grouping its correspondent salient corners according to the geometric properties of each shape . a simulation process is carried out for evaluating the performance of the proposed method . then , it is particularly applied on a real application of batch cooling crystallization of the ammonium oxalate in pure water . the experimental results show that the method is efficient to recognize the overlapping particles of different shapes and sizes .",

in sn <digit> for epsilon o ( <digit> ) . this construction leads to an efficient oblivious derandomization of the goemans williamson max cut algorithm and similar approximation algorithms ( i.e. , we construct a small set of hyperplanes such that for any instance we can choose one of them to generate a good solution ) . our technique for constructing an epsilon sample for linear threshold

software package capable of modifying a rough plane sketch , so as to make it a true projection of a 3d scene . the starting point of the projective geometric analysis of scenes is the observation that the set of all three dimensional realizations ( scenes ) having a given two dimensional projection ( a drawing , or image ) form a linear space . much information about an image , and about its possible spatial interpretations , can be obtained simply by calculating ( either locally or globally ) the linear dimension ( or rank ) of its linear space of scenes . in practice , the image is a pattern on a cathode ray tube , an aerial photograph , an engineer 's or architect 's drawing , or an x ray or nmr scan . the rank of its space of scenes will reveal whether there is ambiguity or uniqueness in the construction of its spatial interpretation , or whether such a construction is in fact impossible , as would be the case for a poorly conceived engineering drawing , or even in an otherwise correctly conceived drawing , if too many hypotheses are made concerning the 3d structure of the scene . calculation of the rank of the space of scenes having a given image should , in principle , be accomplished using simple combinatorial algorithms based on easily remembered rules of thumb . this is the goal , and it shows every sign of being achievable . the problem has , however , a certain degree of unavoidable difficulty . the requirement that a given image be an accurate projection of a non trivial ( non planar ) 3d scene imposes conditions on the image , conditions which are perhaps best described in terms of not always elementary constructions with straight edge and pencil . in this paper , we begin to sort out the interplay of these projective conditions by creating a new homology theory for geometric configurations . the new homology theory applies to geometric objects which are more rigid , less pliable , than the rubber sheets studied by the topology of henri poincar and his school . the passage to this higher degree of invariance is made possible by the creation of a homology theory with ( restricted ) vector , rather than ( unrestricted ) scalar , coefficients , or equivalently , by the use of a cohomology theory based on locally linear , rather than on locally constant , functions . we have verified that the new theory agrees with the cohomology theory for the sheaf of locally linear functions on a certain ( combinatorially defined ) topological space . the basic objects about which this new homology theory has something non trivial to say are extremely general . from the geometric point of view , they are simply finite sets of points in a projective space or finite sets of vectors in a vector space . in order to emphasize the departure we take from linear algebra as it is usually practiced , we should say that we study vector spaces with a selected basis , that is , concrete vector spaces , in their usual representation as spaces f p of functions from a set p into a field f. finally , we might say we are simply studying rectangular matrices . since such objects are found throughout applied mathematics , the resulting homology theory has a very broad range of potential application . indeed , potential applications of this new homology theory are to any domain where one is interested in the global behavior of systems determined locally by linear constraints .", "imagesense towards contextual image advertising . <sep> the daunting volumes of community contributed media contents on the internet

associates relevant ads with an image rather than the entire text in a web page and seamlessly inserts the ads in the nonintrusive areas within each individual image . the proposed system , called imagesense , supports scalable advertising of , from root to node , web sites , pages , and images . in imagesense , the ads are selected based on not only textual relevance but also visual similarity

blind estimation methods of phase sequences are proposed for subcarrier phase control based peak to average power ratio ( papr ) reduction in low density parity check ( ldpc ) coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) systems . on the transmitter side phase sequence patterns are constructed based on a given parity check matrix . the papr of the ofdm signal is reduced by multiplying the constructed phase sequence selected from the same number of candidates as the number of weighting factor ( wf ) combinations in a partial transmit sequence ( pts ) method . on the receiver side the phase sequence is estimated blindly using the decoding function i e the most likely phase sequence among a limited number of possible phase sequence candidates is inferred by

tight integration of sat and mathematical decision procedures . <sep> recent improvements in propositional satisfiability techniques ( sat ) made it possible to tackle successfully some hard real world problems ( e.g. , model checking , circuit testing , propositional planning ) by encoding into sat . however , a purely boolean representation is not expressive enough for many other real world applications , including the verification of timed and hybrid systems , of proof obligations in software , and of circuit design at rtl level . these problems can be naturally modeled as satisfiability in linear arithmetic logic ( lal ) , that is , the boolean combination of propositional variables and linear constraints over numerical variables . in this paper we present mathsat , a new , sat based decision procedure for lal , based on the ( known approach ) of integrating a state of the art sat solver with a dedicated mathematical solver for lal . we improve mathsat in two different directions . first , the top level line procedure is enhanced and now features a tighter integration between the boolean search and the mathematical solver . in particular , we allow for theory driven backjumping and learning , and theory driven deduction we use static learning in order to reduce the number of boolean models that are mathematically inconsistent we exploit problem clustering in order to partition mathematical reasoning and we define a stack based interface that allows us to implement mathematical reasoning in an incremental and backtrackable way . second , the mathematical solver is based on layering that is , the consistency of ( partial ) assignments is checked in theories of increasing strength ( equality and uninterpreted functions , linear arithmetic over the reals , linear arithmetic over the integers ) . for each of these layers , a dedicated ( sub ) solver is used . cheaper solvers are called first , and detection of inconsistency makes call of the subsequent solvers superfluous . we provide a through experimental evaluation of our approach , by taking into account a large set of previously proposed benchmarks . we first investigate the relative benefits and drawbacks of each proposed technique by comparison with respect to a reference option setting . we then demonstrate the global effectiveness of our approach by a comparison with several state of the art decision procedures . we show that the behavior of mathsat is often superior to its competitors , both on lal and in the subclass of difference logic .", "strongly regular

clusters via an iterative stochastic process and are visualized as distributions over the time lines . the visual evaluation model provides shape evaluations as quantitative tools and users ' interactions as qualitative tools to visually investigate the trends , patterns represented by the keyword clusters ' distributions . the keyword clustering model , guided by the feedback of visual evaluations , step wisely enumerates newer generations of keyword clusters and their patterns , therefore narrows down the search space . then the proposed ivc is applied onto nursing narratives and is able to identify interesting keyword clusters implying hidden knowledge regarding to the working patterns and environment of registered nurses . the loop of producing next generation of keyword clusters in ivc is driven and controlled by users ' perception , domain knowledge and interactions , and it is also guided by a stochastic search model . so both semantic and distribution features enable ivc to have significant applications as a text mining tool , on many other data sets , such as biomedical literatures .", "economic growth , telecommunications development and productivity

information and local texture color similarities have to be considered . to this end , we propose a hybrid graph model ( hgm ) that can make effective use of both symmetric and asymmetric relationship among samples . the vertices of a hybrid graph represent the samples and are connected by directed edges and or undirected ones , which represent the asymmetric and or symmetric relationship between them , respectively . when applied to object segmentation , vertices are superpixels , the asymmetric relationship is the conditional dependence of occurrence , and the symmetric relationship is the color texture similarity . by combining the markov chain formed by the directed subgraph and the minimal cut of the undirected subgraph , the object boundaries can be determined for each image . using the hgm , we can conveniently achieve simultaneous segmentation and recognition by integrating both top down and bottom up information into a unified process . experiments on <digit> object classes (

difficulty on hierarchical problems decomposed by levels for rmhc2 . rmhc2 is a hill climbing algorithm augmented with a multi level selection scheme . when used with the ideal sieve for a problem , as is done in this paper , rmhc2 exerts top down control on the evolutionary dynamics , in the sense that adaptation of higher levels are given priority over adaptation of lower levels , and creates stabilizing selection pressure with potential to increase evolvability . through hiff m , we discovered that the summary statistic , fitness distance correlation by level , is not a reliable indicator of when a hierarchical problem is solvable by rmhc2 , and that the two properties proposed to explain search easiness for rmhc2 are inadequate . our investigation of this anomaly led us to propose an additional property for hierarchical evolution difficulty under rmhc2 inter level conflict . we also discuss how hierarchical control can be subverted through the information transfer capacity of the

quadratic spline approximation using detail multi layer for soft shadow generation in augmented reality . <sep> implementation of shadows is crucial to enhancement of images in ar environments . without shadows , virtual objects would look floating over the scene resulting in unrealistic rendering of ar environments . casting hard shadows would provide only spatial information while soft shadows help improve realism of ar environments . several algorithms have been proposed to render realistic shadows which often incurred high computational costs . little attention has been directed towards the balanced trade off between shadow quality and computational costs . in this study , two approaches are proposed quadratic spline interpolation ( qsi ) to soften the outline of the shadow and detail multi layer ( dml ) technique to optimize the volume of computations for the generation of soft shadows based on real light sources . qsi estimates boarder hard shadow samples while dml involves three main phases real light sources estimation , soft shadow production and reduction of the complexity of <digit> dimensional objects shadows . to be more precise , a reflective hemisphere is used to capture real light and to create an environment map . the median cut algorithm is implemented to locate the direction of real light sources on the environment map . subsequently , the original hard shadows are retrieved and a sample of multilayer hard shadows is produced where each layer has its unique size and colour . these layers overlap to produce soft shadows based on the real

approach utilizes the failure free lsps to transmit the traffic of the failed lsp ( the affected traffic ) . to avoid affecting the original traffic of each failure free lsp , the proposed approach applies the solution of the minimum cost flow to determine the amount of affected traffic to be transmitted by each failure free lsp . for transmitting the affected traffic along a failure free working lsp , ip tunneling technique is used . we also propose a permission token scheme to solve the packet disorder problem . finally , simulation experiments are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach .", "designing a cross language comparison shopping agent . <sep> this research pertains to the design and development of a shopbot called webshopper . this shopbot is

"multi relay cooperative diversity protocol with improved spectral efficiency . <sep> cooperative diversity protocols have attracted a great deal of attention since they are thought to be capable of providing diversity multiplexing tradeoff among single antenna wireless devices . in the high signal to noise ratio ( snr ) region , cooperation is rarely required hence , the spectral efficiency of the cooperative protocol can be improved by applying a proper cooperation selection technique . in this paper , we present a simple cooperation selection technique based on instantaneous channel measurement to improve the spectral efficiency of cooperative protocols . we show that the same instantaneous channel measurement can also be used for relay selection . in this paper two protocols are proposed proactive and reactive the selection of one of these protocols depends on whether the decision of cooperation selection is made before or after the transmission of the source . these protocols can successfully select cooperation along with the best relay from a set of available m relays . if the instantaneous source to destination channel is strong enough to support the system requirements , then the source simply transmits to the destination as a noncooperative direct transmission otherwise , a cooperative transmission with the help of the selected best relay is chosen by the system . analysis and simulation results show that these protocols can achieve higher order diversity with improved spectral efficiency , i.e. , a higher diversity multiplexing tradeoff in a slow

out whether the classifier based on gaussian mixture models ( gmms ) could be applied for evaluation of male and female resynthesized speech that had been transformed from neutral to four emotional states ( joy , surprise , sadness , and anger ) spoken in czech and slovak languages . we suppose that it is possible to combine this gmm based statistical evaluation with the classical one in the form of listening tests or it can replace them . for verification of our working hypothesis , a simple gmm emotional speech classifier with a one level structure was realized . the next task of the performed experiment was to investigate the influence of different types and values ( mean , median , standard deviation , relative maximum , etc. ) of the used speech features ( spectral and or supra segmental ) on the gmm classification accuracy . the obtained gmm evaluation scores are compared with the results of the conventional listening tests based on the mean opinion scores . in addition , correctness of the gmm classification is analyzed with respect to the influence of the setting of the parameters during the gmm trainingthe number of mixture components and the types of speech features . the paper also describes the comparison experiment with the reference speech corpus taken from the berlin database of emotional speech in german language as the benchmark for the evaluation of the performance of our one level gmm classifier . the obtained results confirm practical usability of the developed gmm classifier , so we will continue in this research with the aim to increase

however , critical infrastructures are not isolated , but instead are tightly coupled , creating a complex system of interconnected infrastructures . dependencies between critical infrastructures can cause a failure to propagate from one critical infrastructure to other critical infrastructures , aggravating and prolonging the societal impact . for this reason , critical infrastructure operators must understand the complexity of critical infrastructures and the effects of critical infrastructure dependencies . however , a major problem is posed by the fact that detailed information about critical infrastructure dependencies is highly sensitive and is usually not publicly available . moreover , except for a small number of holistic and dynamic research efforts , studies are limited to a few critical infrastructures and generally do not consider time dependent behavior . this paper analyzes how a failed critical infrastructure that can not deliver products and services impacts other critical infrastructures , and how a critical infrastructure is affected when another critical infrastructure fails . the approach involves a holistic analysis involving multiple critical infrastructures while incorporating a dynamic perspective based on the time period that a critical infrastructure is non operational and how the impacts evolve over time . this holistic approach , which draws on the results of a survey of critical infrastructure experts from several countries , is intended to assist critical infrastructure operators in preparing for future crises .", "traffic distribution for end to end qos routing with multicast multichannel services . <sep> with the development of multimedia group applications and multicasting demands , the construction of multicast routing tree satisfying quality of service ( qos ) is more important . a multicast tree , which is constructed by existing multicast algorithms , suffers three major weaknesses ( <digit> ) it can not be constructed by multichannel routing , transmitting a message using all available links , thus the data traffic can not be preferably distributed ( <digit> ) it does not formulate duplication capacity consequently , duplication capacity in each node can not be optimally distributed ( <digit> ) it can not change the number of links and nodes used optimally . in fact , it can not employ and cover unused backup multichannel paths optimally . to overcome these weaknesses , this paper presents a polynomial time algorithm for distributed optimal multicast routing and quality of service ( qos

end delay across the multichannel paths , ( <digit> ) to minimize consumption of bandwidth by using all available links , and ( <digit> ) to maximize data rate by formulating network resources . dommr is based on the linear programming formulation ( lpf ) and presents an iterative optimal solution to obtain the best distributed routes for traffic demands between all edge nodes . computational experiments and numerical simulation results will show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the existing methods . the simulation results are obtained by applying network simulation

algorithm for the discrete pulse transform . <sep> the discrete pulse transform ( dpt ) is a decomposition of an observed signal into a sum of pulses , i.e. , signals that are constant on a connected set and zero elsewhere . originally developed for <digit> d signal processing , the dpt has recently been generalized to more dimensions . applications in image processing are currently being investigated . the time required to compute the dpt as originally defined via the successive application of lulu operators ( members of a class of minimax filters studied by rohwer ) has been a severe drawback to its applicability . this paper introduces a fast method for obtaining such a decomposition , called the roadmaker 's algorithm because it involves filling pits and razing bumps . it acts selectively only on those features actually present in the signal , flattening them in order of increasing size by sub tracing an appropriate positive or negative pulse , which is then appended to the decomposition . the implementation described here covers <digit> d signal as well as two and <digit> d image processing in a single framework . this is achieved by considering the signal or image as a function defined on a graph , with the geometry specified by the edges of the graph . whenever a feature is flattened , nodes in the graph are merged , until eventually only one node remains . at that stage , a new set of edges for the same nodes as the graph , forming a tree structure , defines the obtained decomposition . the roadmaker 's algorithm is shown to be equivalent to the dpt in the sense of obtaining the same decomposition . however , its simpler operators are not in general equivalent to the lulu operators in situations where those operators are not applied successively . a by product of the roadmaker 's algorithm is that it yields a proof of the so called highlight conjecture , stated as an open problem in <digit> . we pay particular attention to algorithmic details and

, called lumiproxies , are constructed to represent the equivalent visual appearance . the hough transform is used to find the positions of these textured planes , and optic flow measures are used to determine their textures . for remaining pixels corresponding to the non planar geometries , the point primitive is applied , reorganized as the obb tree structure . then , texture mapping and point splatting are employed together to render the novel views , with the hardware acceleration .", "constraint based methods for biological sequence analysis . <sep> the need for processing biological information is rapidly growing , owing to the masses of new information in digital form being produced at this time . old methodologies for processing it can no longer keep up with this rate of growth . the methods of artificial intelligence ( ai ) in general and of language processing in particular can offer much towards solving this problem . however , interdisciplinary research between language processing and molecular biology is not yet widespread , partly because of the effort needed for each specialist to understand the other one 's jargon . we argue that by looking at the problems of molecular biology from a language processing perspective , and using constraint based logic methodologies we can shorten the gap and make interdisciplinary collaborations more effective . we shall discuss several sequence analysis problems in terms of constraint based formalisms such concept formation rules , constraint handling rules ( chr ) and their grammatical counterpart , chrg . we postulate that genetic structure analysis can also benefit from these methods , for instance to reconstruct from a given rna secondary structure , a nucleotide sequence that folds into it . our proposed methodologies lend direct executability to high level descriptions of the problems at hand and thus contribute to rapid while efficient prototyping .", "adaptive load balancing algorithm for multiple homing mobile nodes . <sep> in places where mobile users can access multiple wireless networks simultaneously , a multipath scheduling algorithm can benefit the performance of wireless networks and improve the experience of mobile users . however , existing literature shows that it may not be the case , especially for tcp flows . according to early investigations , there are mainly two reasons that result in bad performance of tcp flows in wireless networks . one is the occurrence of out of order packets due to different delays in multiple paths . the other is the packet loss which is resulted from the limited bandwidth of wireless networks . to better exploit multipath scheduling for tcp flows , this paper presents a new scheduling algorithm named adaptive load balancing algorithm ( albam ) to split traffic across multiple wireless links within the isp infrastructure . targeting at solving the two adverse impacts on tcp flows , albam develops two techniques . firstly , albam takes advantage of the bursty nature of tcp flows and performs scheduling at the flowlet granularity where the packet interval is large enough to compensate for the different path delays . secondly , albam develops a packet number estimation algorithm ( pnea ) to predict the buffer usage in each path . with pnea , albam can prevent buffer overflow and schedule the tcp flow to a less congested path before it suffers packet loss . simulations show that albam can provide better performance to tcp connections than its other counterparts .", "query by output . <sep> it has recently been asserted that the usability of a database is as important as its capability . understanding the database schema , the hidden relationships among attributes in the data all play an important role in this context . subscribing to this viewpoint , in this paper , we present a novel data driven approach , called query by output ( qbo ) , which can enhance the usability of database systems . the central goal of qbo is as follows given the output of some query q on a database d , denoted by q ( d ) , we wish to construct an alternative query q such that q ( d ) and q ( d ) are instance equivalent . to generate instance equivalent queries from q ( d ) , we devise a novel data classification based technique that can handle the at least one semantics that is inherent in the query derivation . in addition to the basic framework , we design several optimization techniques to reduce processing overhead and introduce a set of criteria to rank order output queries by various notions of utility . our framework is evaluated comprehensively on three real data sets and the results show that the instance equivalent queries we obtain are interesting and that the approach is scalable and robust to queries of different selectivities .", "three dimensional quantitative structureactivity relationships study on hiv <digit> reverse transcriptase inhibitors in the class of

<sep> this paper proposes an effective jpeg <digit> encoding method for reducing tiling artifacts , which cause one of the biggest problems in jpeg <digit> encoders . symmetric pixel extension is

accuracy by the original post quantization control . this paper further proposes a method for reducing processing time which is yet another serious problem in the jpeg <digit> encoder . the method works by predicting truncation points using the entropy of wavelet transform coefficients prior to the arithmetic coding . these encoding methods require no additional processing in the decoder . the

technical issues , ( <digit> ) patient safety and care , and ( <digit> ) communication and confidentiality . the items were used to track expectations prior to implementation and they served as retrospective measures of satisfaction with the emr in post implementation time <digit> and time <digit> . the findings suggest that physicians conceptualize emrs as an incremental extension of older computerized provider order entries ( cpoes ) rather than as a new innovation . the emrs major functional advantages are seen to be very similar to , if not the same as , those of cpoes . technology learning curves play a statistically significant though minor role in shaping physician perceptions . the physicians expectations from the emr are based on their prior beliefs rather than on a rational evaluation of the emr 's fit , functionality , or performance . their decision regarding the usefulness of the emr is made very early , within the first few months of use of the emr . these early perceptions then remain stable and become the lens through which subsequent experience with the emr is interpreted . the findings suggest a need for communication based interventions aimed at explaining the value , fit , and usefulness of emrs to physicians early in the pre and immediate post emr implementation stages .", "application of the lattice boltzmann method to flow in aneurysm

inserting virtual objects in real camera images with correct lighting is an active area of research . current methods use a high dynamic range camera with a fish eye lens to capture the incoming

interactive movement of virtual objects in the camera image of a real room . the daylight , which is coming in through the windows , produces a spatially varying distribution of indirect light in the

be implicit such as in cyclic sequence comparison , or as in the maximization of length normalized scores , and driven by practical considerations . we present a survey of approximation algorithms for various alignment problems with constraints , and several new approximation algorithms . these approximations are in two distinct senses in one the constraints are satisfied but the score computed is within a prescribed tolerance of the optimum instead of the exact optimum . in another , the alignment returned is assured to have at least the optimum score with respect to the given constraints ,

<sep> nowadays , polynomial interpretations are an essential ingredient in the development of tools for proving termination . we have recently proven that polynomial interpretations over the reals are strictly better for proving polynomial termination of rewriting than those which only use integer coefficients . some essential aspects of their practical use , though , remain unexplored or underdeveloped . in this paper , we compare the two current frameworks for using polynomial intepretations over the reals and show that one of them is strictly better than the other , thus making a suitable choice for implementations . we also prove that the use of algebraic real co efficients in the interpretations suffice for termination proofs . we also discuss the use of algorithms and techniques from tarski 's first order logic of the real closed fields for implementing their use in proofs of termination . we argue that more standard constraint solving techniques are better suited for this . we propose an algorithm to solve the polynomial constraints which arise when specific finite subsets of rational ( or even algebraic real ) numbers are considered for giving value to the coefficients . we provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of the algorithm which has been implemented as part of the termination tool mu term .", "detecting coherent energy . <sep> we apply the

structure systems approach to control the training dynamics . this results in an optimal selection of the learning rate , which is continually updated as prescribed by the adopted strategy . the parameter update rule is then mixed with the conventional error backpropagation method in a weighted average . the paper presents an analysis of the imposed dynamics , which is the response of the training dynamics driven solely by the inputs designed by variable structure control approach . the analysis continues with the global stability proof of the mixed training methodology and the

simulations . <sep> pore scale simulations using a lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) based numerical model were conducted to examine how the capillary pressure ( pc ) ( p c ) and saturation ( s ) evolve within a virtual porous medium subjected to drainage and imbibition cycles . the results show the presence of a sharp front ( interface separating the wetting and non wetting fluids ) across the cell during the test , which expectably moves up and down as the controlling non wetting fluid pressure at the upper boundary varies to simulate different pc p c levels over the drainage and imbibition cycle . this phenomenon , representing inhomogeneity at the simulated scale , is in conflict with the homogenization applied to the pressure cell for deriving the constitutive pcs p c s relationship . different boundary conditions , adopted to achieve more homogeneous states in the virtual soil , resulted in different pcs p c s curves . no unique relationship between pc p c and s , even with the interfacial area ( anw ) ( a nw ) included , could be found . this study shows dependence of the lbm predicted pcs p c s relation on the chosen boundary conditions . this effect should be taken into account in future numerical studies of multiphase flow within porous media .", "a generic sampling framework for improving anomaly detection in the next generation network . <sep> the heterogeneous nature of network traffic in next generation networks ( ngns ) may impose scalability issue to traffic monitoring applications . while this issue can be well addressed by existing sampling approaches , owing to their inherent ' lossy ' characteristic and data reduction principle , traditional sampling techniques suffer from incomplete traffic statistics , which can lead to inaccurate inferences of the network traffic . by focusing on two distinct traffic monitoring applications , namely , anomaly detection and traffic measurement , we highlight the possibility of

accurate traffic measurement ) , and thus addressing the accuracy of both applications concurrently . with the emphasize on the accuracy of anomaly detection and the scalability of monitoring devices

which many regions ( or superpixels ) with homogeneous color are detected , an image segmentation is performed by iteratively merging the regions according to a statistical test . there are two essential issues in a region merging algorithm order of merging and the stopping criterion . in the proposed algorithm , these two issues are solved by a novel predicate , which is defined by the sequential probability ratio test and the minimal cost criterion . starting from an oversegmented image , neighboring regions are progressively merged if there is an evidence for merging according to this predicate . we show that the merging order follows the principle of dynamic programming . this formulates the image segmentation as an inference problem , where the final segmentation is established based on the observed image . we also prove that the produced segmentation satisfies certain global properties . in addition , a faster algorithm is developed to accelerate the region

from measured frequency response functions . <sep> engineering structures seldom behave linearly and , as a result , linearity checks are common practice in the testing of critical structures exposed to dynamic loading to define the boundary of validity of the linear regime . however , in large scale industrial applications , there is no general methodology for dynamicists to extract nonlinear parameters from measured vibration data so that these can be then included in the associated numerical models . in this paper , a simple method based on the information contained in the frequency response function ( frf ) properties of a structure is studied . this technique falls within the category of single degree of freedom ( sdof ) modal analysis methods . the principle upon which it is based is effectively a linearisation whereby it is assumed that at given amplitude of displacement response the system responds at the same frequency as the excitation and that stiffness and damping are constants . in so doing , by extracting this information at different amplitudes of vibration response , it is possible to estimate the amplitude dependent natural frequency and modal loss factor . because of its mathematical simplicity and practical implementation during standard vibration testing , this method is particularly suitable for practical applications . in this paper , the method is illustrated and new analyses are carried out to validate its performance on numerical simulations before applying it to data measured on a complex aerospace test structure as well as a full scale

multifaceted cognitive methodology for the characterization of cognitive demands of a medical information system . our investigation was informed by the distributed resources ( dr ) model , a novel approach designed to describe the dimensions of user interfaces that introduce unnecessary cognitive complexity . this method evaluates the relative distribution of external ( system ) and internal (

framework within which many well known and important problems can be formulated . in particular , the existence of arc disjoint branching flows , that is , flows which send one unit of flow from a given source s s to all other vertices , generalizes the concept of arc disjoint out branchings ( spanning out trees ) in a digraph . a pair of out branchings b s , <digit> , b s , <digit> from a root

studied primarily in the context of double ended queues where each demands service from the other , typically taxis and passengers . related models , single queue , and double , with a variety of mechanisms are considered . impatience is to be understood in a wider context than simply becoming tired of waiting it can arise because the customer , for some reason , runs out of time ( inventory and organ transplantation ) , or because an alternative service becomes available ( communication applications ) . the emphasis in this paper is theoretical but a brief numerical assessment of operational consequences is given . the double ended ( or synchronization ) queue is a model for a variety of service demanding providing systems . in an orderly taxi rank at a railway station or airport , on one side a queue is formed by the arrival of stream of passengers who wait for taxis to their destinations while on the other side a queue of taxis waiting for passengers . obviously , the two queues can never coexist . the concept of impatience enters when a taxi or passenger leaves the queue before receiving service . this concept of reneging is widely applicable . in health care , for example , organs are stored for transplantation for needful patients . both the organs and the demands for them have limited lifetime . a similar scenario applies to perishable inventory systems . in a similar manner , the real time communication networks admit impatient behaviour . a typical example is a processor shared queue in data networks with random time out periods or deadlines . the paper sets out the basics in a variety of theoretical model settings with the common feature of exponential arrival , service and impatience mechanisms . a brief discussion based on numerical

lyosol . the system makes use of an optical goniometer . it allows to measure angular distribution of intensity of the light scattered on the lyosol sample . the distribution of the intensity ( indicatrix ) depends on the shape and size of the nanoparticles . we developed a method of theoretical indicatrix calculation of the nanoplates with the use of amsterdam discrete dipole approximation method . the experimentally measured indicatrix is compared with the theoretical calculations ( standardized indicatrices ) . we observed that the nanoplate has a dual character of light scattering . it can scatter light as a small or big particle according to the direction of the incident light beam . we have applied the proposed method of characterization for a water suspension of graphene

our model against ns2 simulations ( using an ieee 802.15.4 module developed by zheng <digit> ) . we find that with the default back off parameters the saturation throughput decreases sharply with increasing number of nodes . we use our analytical model to study the problem and we propose alternative back off parameters that prevent the drop in throughput . we then show how the saturation analysis can be used to obtain an analytical model for the finite arrival rate case . this finite load model captures very well the qualitative behavior of the system , and also provides a good approximation to the packet discard probability , and the throughput . for the default parameters , the finite load throughput is found to first increase and then decrease with increasing load . we

pertinent to many learning algorithms , and it denotes the drastic raise of computational complexity and classification error in high dimensions . in this paper , different feature extraction ( fe ) techniques are analyzed as means of dimensionality reduction , and constructive induction with respect to the performance of nave bayes classifier . when a data set contains a large number of instances , some sampling approach is applied to address the computational complexity of fe and classification processes . the main goal of this paper is to show the impact of sample reduction on the process of fe for supervised learning . in our study we analyzed the conventional pca and two eigenvector based approaches that take into account class information . the first class conditional approach is parametric and optimizes the ratio of between class variance to the within class variance of the transformed data . the second approach is a nonparametric modification of the first one based on the local calculation of the between class covariance matrix . the experiments are conducted on ten uci data sets , using four different strategies to select samples ( <digit> ) random sampling , ( <digit> ) stratified random sampling , ( <digit> ) kd tree based selective sampling , and ( <digit> ) stratified sampling with kd tree based selection . our experiments show that if the

needs much less instances to produce a new representation space that result in the same or higher classification accuracy than the other fe approaches .", "a topology preserving level set method for geometric deformable models . <sep> active contour and surface models , also known as deformable models , are powerful image segmentation techniques . geometric deformable models implemented using level set methods have advantages over parametric models due to their intrinsic behavior , parameterization independence , and ease of implementation . however , a long claimed advantage of geometric deformable models the ability to automatically handle topology changes turns out to be a liability in applications where the object to be segmented has a known topology that must be preserved . in this paper , we present a new class of geometric deformable models designed using a novel topology preserving level set method , which achieves topology preservation by applying the simple point concept from digital topology . these new models maintain the other advantages of standard geometric deformable models including subpixel accuracy and production of nonintersecting curves or surfaces

deformable models . several experiments on simulated and real data are provided to demonstrate the performance of this new deformable model algorithm .", "elastic geodesic paths in shape space of parameterized surfaces . <sep> this paper presents a novel riemannian framework for shape analysis of parameterized surfaces . in particular , it provides efficient algorithms for computing geodesic paths which , in turn , are important for comparing , matching , and deforming surfaces . the novelty of this framework is that geodesics are invariant to the parameterizations of surfaces and other shape preserving transformations of surfaces . the basic idea is to formulate a space of embedded surfaces ( surfaces seen as embeddings of a unit sphere in r <digit> ) and impose a riemannian metric on it in such a way that the reparameterization group acts on this space by isometries . under this framework , we solve two optimization problems . one , given any two surfaces at arbitrary rotations and parameterizations , we use a path straightening approach to find a geodesic path between them under the chosen metric . second , by modifying a technique presented in <digit> , we solve for the optimal rotation and parameterization ( registration ) between surfaces . their combined solution provides an efficient mechanism for computing geodesic paths in shape spaces of parameterized surfaces . we illustrate these ideas using examples from shape analysis of anatomical structures and other general surfaces .", "on the coupling of the homotopy perturbation method and laplace transformation .

coefficient . the aim of using the laplace transform is to overcome the deficiency that is mainly caused by unsatisfied conditions in other semi analytical methods such as hpm , vim , and adm. the approximate solutions obtained by means of lhpm in a wide range of the problem 's domain were compared with those results obtained from the actual solutions , the homotopy perturbation method ( hpm ) and the finite element method . the comparison shows a precise agreement between the results , and introduces this new method as an applicable one which it needs fewer computations and is much easier

design el_rss to recommend resources to individuals however , an investigation of recommendations to a group of learners in e learning is still in its infancy . in this paper , we focus on the problem of recommending resources to a group of learners rather than to an individual . the major challenge in group recommendation is how to merge the individual preferences of different learners that form a group and extract a pseudo unified learner profile ( ulp ) that closely reflects the preferences of all learners . firstly , we propose a profile merging scheme for the ulp by utilizing learning styles , knowledge levels and ratings of learners in a group . thereafter , a collaborative approach is proposed based on the ulp for effective group recommendations . experimental results are

estimation method , which allows avoiding the necessary knowledge of the channel covariance matrix or its estimation . to do so , a perfectly tunable filter acting like an artificial channel is added at the receiver side . we show that an lmmse estimation of the sum of this artificial channel and the physical channel only needs the covariance matrix of the artificial channel , and the channel estimation is finally obtained by subtracting the frequency coefficients of the added filter . we call this method artificial channel aided lmmse ( aca lmmse ) . theoretical developments and

researchers on the technical assessment and evaluation of environmental models and software . the purpose is to stimulate debate and initiate action that leads to an improved quality of model development and evaluation , so increasing the capacity for models to have positive outcomes from their use . as such , we emphasize the relationship between the model evaluation process and credibility with stakeholders ( including funding agencies ) with a view to ensure continued support for modelling efforts . many journals , including em s , publish the results of environmental modelling studies and must judge the work and the submitted papers based solely on the material that the authors have chosen to present and on how they present it . there is considerable variation in how this is done with the consequent risk of considerable variation in the quality and usefulness of the resulting publication . part of the problem is that the review process is reactive , responding to the submitted manuscript . in this letter , we attempt to be proactive and give guidelines for researchers , authors and reviewers as to what constitutes best practice in presenting environmental modelling results . this is a unique contribution to the organisation and practice of model based research and the communication of its results that will benefit the entire environmental modelling community . for a start , our view is that the community of environmental modellers should have a common vision of minimum standards that an environmental model must meet . a common vision of what a good model should be is expressed in various guidelines on good modelling practice . the guidelines prompt modellers to codify their practice and to be more rigorous in their model testing . our statement within this letter deals with another aspect of the issue it prompts professional journals to codify the peer review process . introducing a more formalized approach to peer review may discourage reviewers from accepting invitations to review given the additional time and labour requirements . the burden of proving model credibility is thus shifted to the authors . here we discuss how to reduce this burden by selecting realistic evaluation criteria and conclude by advocating the use of standardized evaluation tools as this is a key issue that needs to be tackled .", "on the

immediately following an action potential . the difference between the absolute refractory period , when no amount of stimulus will elicit an action potential , and relative refractory period , when an action potential may be generated by applying increased stimulus , was demonstrated with regard to the underlying state of the na and k channels ( <digit> ) temporal summation , a process by which two sub threshold stimuli can unite to elicit an action potential was shown to be due to conductance changes outlasting the first stimulus and summing with the second stimulus induced conductance changes to drive the membrane potential past threshold ( <digit> ) anode break excitation , where membrane hyperpolarization was shown to produce an action potential by removing na channel

be integrated mechanosensors that regulate the activation of the osteoclasts and osteoblasts involved in bone resorption and apposition processes , respectively . after collagen tissue apposition , a process of collagen mineralisation takes place , gradually increasing the effective stiffness of bone . this study presents a new model based on physicochemical parameters involved in spongy bone remodelling under pathological conditions . our model simulates the transient evolution of both geometry and effective young 's modulus of the trabeculae , also taking turnover into account . various loads were applied on a trabecula in order to determine the evolution of bone volume fraction under pathological conditions . a parametric study performed on the model showed that one key parameter

to shift continuously from one control method to the other according to locomotion speed . we are developing such a general quadrupedal locomotion controller by using a neural model involving a cpg ( central pattern generator ) utilizing ground reaction force sensory feedback . we used a biologically faithful musculoskeletal model with a spine and hind legs , and computationally simulated stable stepping motion at various speeds using the neuro mechanical system combining the neural controller and the musculoskeletal model . we compared the changes of the most important locomotion characteristics ( stepping period , duty ratio and support length ) according to speed in our simulations with the data on real cat walking . we found similar tendencies for all of them . in particular , the swing period was approximately constant while the stance period decreased with speed , resulting in a decreasing stepping period and duty ratio . moreover , the support length increased with speed due to the posterior extreme position that shifted progressively caudally , while the anterior extreme position was approximately constant . this indicates that we succeeded in reproducing to some extent the motion of a cat from the kinematical point of view , even though we used a 2d bipedal model . we expect that such computational models will become essential tools for legged locomotion neuroscience in the future .", "on the superlinear local convergence of a filter sqp method . <sep> transition to superlinear local convergence is shown for a modified version of the

parallel finite automaton a new mechanism for deep packet inspection in cloud computing . <sep> security is quite an important issue in cloud computing . the general security mechanisms applied in the cloud are always passive defense methods such as encryption . besides these , it 's necessary to utilize real time active monitoring , detection and defense technologies . according to the published researches , deep packets inspection ( dpi ) is the most effective technology to realize active inspection and defense . however , most of the works on dpi focus on its performance in general application scenarios and make improvement for space reduction , which could not meet the demands of high speed and stability in the cloud . therefore it is meaningful to improve the common mechanisms of dpi , making it more suitable for cloud computing . in this paper , an asynchronous parallel finite automaton ( fa ) is proposed . the applying of asynchronous parallelization and heuristic

stimulation . nine normal subjects participated in fmri studies . by comparing the cortical areas activated by a click at <digit> db ( auditory activation ) with those activated by <digit> db ( auditory plus saccular activation ) , the following cortical areas were selectively activated by saccular stimulation intraparietal sulcus , frontal eye fields , prefrontal cortex , and postcentral

functions over dbm domains in the analysis of non markovian models . <sep> quantitative evaluation of models with generally distributed transitions requires the analysis of non markovian processes that may be not isomorphic to their underlying untimed models and may include any number of concurrent nonexponential timers . the analysis of stochastic time petri nets ( stpns ) copes with the problem by covering the state space with stochastic classes , which extend the theory of difference bounds matrix ( dbm ) with a state probability density function . as a core step , the analysis process requires symbolic manipulation of density functions supported over dbm domains . we characterize and engineer the critical steps of this derivation . we first show that the state density function accepts a continuous piecewise representation over a partition in dbm shaped subdomains . we then develop a closed form symbolic calculus of state density functions under the assumption that transitions in the stpn model have expolynomial distributions over possibly bounded intervals . the calculus shows that within each subdomain , the state density function is a multivariate expolynomial function , and it makes explicit the way in which this form evolves and grows in complexity as the state accumulates memory through subsequent transitions . this enables an efficient implementation of the analysis process and provides the formal basis that supports the introduction of an imprecise analysis based on the approximation of state density functions through bernstein polynomials . the approximation attacks practical and theoretical limits in the applicability of stochastic state classes and devises a new approach to the analysis of non markovian models , relying on approximations in the state space rather than in the structure of the model .", "reanalysis and sensitivity reanalysis by combined approximations . <sep> one of the main obstacles in the solution

the visual artifacts in the transition between images . current seam computation algorithms use optimization methods that may be slow , sequential , memory intensive , and prone to finding suboptimal solutions related to local minima of the chosen energy function . moreover , even when these techniques perform well , their solution may not be perceptually ideal ( or even good ) . such an inflexible approach does not allow the possibility of user based improvement . this paper introduces the panorama weaving technique for seam creation and editing in an image mosaic . first , panorama weaving provides a procedure to create boundaries for panoramas that is fast , has low memory requirements and is easy to parallelize . this technique often produces seams with lower energy than the

speech synthesis , it is desirable to convert both voice characteristics and prosodic features such as f0 and phone duration . for simultaneous adaptation of spectrum , f0 and phone duration within the hmm framework , we need to transform not only the state output distributions corresponding to spectrum and f0 but also the duration distributions corresponding to phone duration . however , it is not straightforward to adapt the state duration because the original hmm does not have explicit duration distributions . therefore , we utilize the framework of the hidden semi markov model ( hsmm ) , which is an hmm having explicit state duration distributions , and we apply an hsmm based model adaptation algorithm to simultaneously transform both the state output and state duration distributions . furthermore , we propose an hsmm based adaptive training algorithm to simultaneously normalize the state output and state duration distributions of the average voice model . we incorporate these

patterns . <sep> sequential pattern mining is essential in many applications , including computational biology , consumer behavior analysis , web log analysis , etc. although sequential patterns can tell us what items are frequently to be purchased together and in what order , they can not provide information about the time span between items for decision support . previous studies dealing with this problem either set time constraints to restrict the patterns discovered or define time intervals between two successive items to provide time information . accordingly , the first approach falls short in providing clear time interval information while the second can not discover time interval information between two non successive items in a sequential pattern . to provide more time related knowledge , we define a new variant of time interval sequential patterns , called multi time interval sequential patterns , which can reveal the time intervals between all pairs of items in a pattern

. <sep> frequent itemset mining only considers the frequency of occurrence of the items but does not reflect any other factors , such as price or profit . utility mining is an extension of frequent itemset mining , considering cost , profit or other measures from user preference . traditionally , the utility of an itemset is the summation of the utilities of the itemset in all the transactions regardless of its length . the average utility measure is thus adopted in this paper to reveal a better utility effect of combining several items than the original utility measure . it is defined as the total utility of an itemset divided by its number of items within it . the average utility itemsets , as well as the original utility itemsets , does not have the downward closure property . a mining algorithm is then proposed to efficiently find the high average utility itemsets . it uses the summation of the maximal utility among the items in each transaction with the target itemset as the upper bound to overestimate the actual average utilities of the itemset and processes it in two phases . as expected , the mined high average utility itemsets in the proposed way will be fewer than the high utility itemsets under the same threshold . the proposed approach can thus be executed under a larger threshold than the original , thus with a more significant and relevant criterion .

data sharing settings , such as within the biological and biomedical communities , global data consistency is not always attainable different sites ' data may be dirty , uncertain , or even controversial . collaborators are willing to share their data , and in many cases they also want to selectively import data from others but must occasionally diverge when they disagree about uncertain or controversial facts or values . for this reason , traditional data sharing and data integration approaches are not applicable , since they require a globally consistent data instance . additionally , many of these approaches do not allow participants to make updates if they do , concurrency control algorithms or inconsistency repair techniques must be used to ensure a consistent view of the data for all users.in this paper , we develop and present a fully decentralized model of collaborative data sharing , in which participants publish their data on an ad hoc basis and simultaneously reconcile updates with those published by others . individual updates are associated with provenance information , and each participant accepts only updates with a sufficient authority ranking , meaning that each participant may have a different ( though conceptually overlapping ) data instance . we define a consistency semantics for database instances under this model of disagreement ,

retrieval , content based categorization and retrieval of 3d computer graphics model is becoming increasingly important . this is due to the increased adoption of 3d graphics representations in multimedia applications and the resulting need for rapid virtual scene assembly from a repository of 3d models . motivated by these requirements , the main focus of this paper is on the content based classification and retrieval of 3d computer graphics models based on a histogram feature representation , and the search for an adaptive transformation of this representation such that the resulting classification and retrieval accuracies are optimized . observing that a histogram is basically an approximation of the probability density function of an underlying random variable , and that a suitable transformation , when applied to the random variable , will allow the classifier to attain better accuracy based on this new representation , we propose an evolutionary optimization approach to search for this set of optimal transformations due to the large size of the search space . in particular , we consider the special class of transformations that take the form of a piecewise continuous mapping . in this case , the transformed variable is a mixed random variable , with both discrete and continuous components , which provides added flexibility for modeling a number of more diverse random variable types . with a suitably defined fitness function for evolutionary strategies ( es ) that measures the capability of the transformed histogram representation to induce the correct class structure , our proposed approach is capable of improving the head model classification performance , which in turn allows , in the case of content based retrieval , the correct

sharper the interface scheme , the more accurate the results are . in the simulation of flows past a circular cylinder , the results from each interface scheme are comparable to those from other corresponding numerical schemes . copyright ( c ) <digit> john wiley sons , ltd .", "precise euclidean distance transforms in 3d from voxel coverage representation . <sep> we propose a method for

forensics . <sep> compared to the prominent role digital images play in nowadays multimedia society , research in the field of image authenticity is still in its infancy . only recently , research on digital image forensics has gained attention by addressing tamper detection and image source identification . however , most publications in this emerging field still lack rigorous discussions of robustness against strategic counterfeiters , who anticipate the existence of forensic techniques . as a result , the question of trustworthiness of digital image forensics arises . this work will take a closer look at two state of the art forensic methods and proposes two counter techniques one to perform resampling operations undetectably and another one to forge traces of image origin . implications for future image forensic systems will be discussed .", "max optimal and sum optimal labelings of graphs . <sep> given a graph g , a function f v ( g ) > <digit> , <digit> , ... , k is a k ranking of g if f ( u ) f ( v ) implies that every u v path contains a vertex w such that f ( w ) > f ( u ) . a k ranking is minimal if the reduction of any label greater than <digit> violates the described ranking property . we consider two norms for minimal rankings . the max optimal norm parallel to f ( g ) parallel to ( infinity ) is the smallest k for which g has a minimal k ranking . this value is also referred to as the rank number chi ( r ) ( g ) . in this paper we introduce the sum optimal norm parallel to f ( g ) parallel to ( <digit> ) which is the minimum sum of all labels over

"power distribution system optimization by an algorithm for capacitated steiner tree problems with complex flows and arbitrary cost functions . <sep> an algorithm called genetic shortest path algorithm is presented to solve capacitated minimal steiner tree problems in graphs with complex flows and arbitrary arc cost functions , but without negative cycles . voltage constraint can also been taken into consideration by the algorithm . hence , it can solve various power distribution system optimization problems with detailed mathematical models . in the proposed algorithm , a local optimization method based on shortest path algorithm and heuristics is used to find the local optimums , in which the minimum cost objective and all constraints are considered and the specialties of the problems are made good use of . genetic operations are only used to search the global optimum from the local optimums . therefore , this algorithm overcomes the disadvantage of general genetic algorithm in local searching . an example for distribution system planning problem with large scale is given to demonstrate the power of the algorithm .", "qmbr ( i ) inverse quantization of minimum bounding rectangles for spatial data compression . <sep> in this paper , we propose qmbr ( i ) , the inverse representation of the quantized minimum bounding rectangles ( mbrs ) scheme , which compresses a minimum bounding rectangle key into one byte for spatial data compression . qmbr ( i ) is a novel spatial data compression scheme that is based on inverse quantization and overcomes the shortcomings of conventional relative coordination or quantization schemes . if a spatial data is far from the starting point of the search region , the relative coordination scheme does not guarantee compression . in a quantization scheme , since the mbrs are expanded , the overlapping of mbrs is increased and the search performance is reduced . the proposed scheme overcomes these shortcomings , and simulation results suggest that it performs better than other schemes .", "two dimensional model of base force element method ( bfem ) on complementary energy principle for geometrically nonlinear
