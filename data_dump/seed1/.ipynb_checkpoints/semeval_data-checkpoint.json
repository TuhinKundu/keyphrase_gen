{"src": ["scalable grid service discovery based on uddi . <sep> efficient discovery of grid services is essential for the success of grid computing . the standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids even though uddi has been the de facto industry standard for web services discovery , imposed requirements of tight replication among registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage . with the advent of grid computing the scalability issue of uddi will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids . in this paper we present our distributed web service discovery architecture , called dude ( distributed uddi deployment engine ) . dude leverages dht ( distributed hash tables ) as a rendezvous mechanism between multiple uddi registries . dude enables consumers to query multiple registries , still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries . . based on preliminary prototype on planetlab , we believe that dude architecture can support effective distribution of uddi registries thereby making uddi more robust and also addressing its scaling issues . furthermore , the dude architecture for scalable distribution can be applied beyond uddi to any grid service discovery

inherently heterogeneous and dynamic . one important problem in grid computing is resource selection , that is , finding an appropriate resource set for the application . another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid environment . existing solutions to these two problems require that a performance model for an application is known . however , constructing such models is a complex task . in this paper , we investigate an approach that does not require performance models . we start an application on any set of resources . during the application run , we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and deduce application requirements from these statistics . then , we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs . this approach allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks , such as overloaded wan links or very slow processors , and therefore can yield significant performance improvements . we evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the grid . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer communication networks distributed systems distributed applications c . <digit> performance of

switched networks , like the internet , do not offer a reliable transmission of packets to applications with real time constraints such as voice . thus , the loss of packets impairs the application level utility . for voice this utility impairment is twofold on one hand , even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted . on the other hand , some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets . we first develop an end to end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow . these packet level metrics are then linked to user level objective speech quality metrics . using this framework , we find that for low compressing sample based codecs ( pcm ) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well , whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact . for high compressing frame based codecs ( g . <digit> ) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories , though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state . contrary to sample based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however . we then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss . we designate these methods as intra flow loss recovery and control . at the end to end level , identification of packets sensitive to loss ( sender ) as well as loss concealment ( receiver ) takes place . hop by hop support schemes then allow to ( statistically ) trade the loss of one packet , which is considered more important , against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance . as both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission , a gain in user perception is obtainable . we show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer

and implementation of a distributed content management system . <sep> the convergence of advances in storage , encoding , and networking technologies has brought us to an environment where huge amounts of continuous media content is routinely stored and exchanged between network enabled devices . keeping track of ( or managing ) such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data . storing live continuous media ( such as tv or radio content ) adds to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with . networked storage allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection to in fact be distributed across a network , making the task of content management all but impossible to deal with without a content management system . in this paper we present the design and implementation of the spectrum content management system , which deals with rich media content effectively in this environment . spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application to both stand alone and various networked scenarios . a unique aspect of spectrum is that it requires one ( or more ) retention policies to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system . this means that there are no eviction policies . content that no longer has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the system . different retention policies can easily be applied to the same content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication . this approach also allows spectrum to easily apply time based policies which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of live continuous media , to content . we not only describe the details of the spectrum architecture but also give typical use cases . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer systems organization computer communication networks distributed systems h . <digit> . <digit>

typical tree structures . this paper presents bullet , a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes spread across the internet to self organize into a high bandwidth overlay mesh . we construct bullet around the insight that data should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in the network . individual bullet receivers are then responsible for locating and retrieving the data from multiple points in parallel . key contributions of this work include i ) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally

running across the internet and in a large scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth improvements under a variety of circumstances . in addition , we find that , relative to

application systems such as second <unk> provide 3d virtual environments where multiple users interact with each other in real time . they are filled with autonomous , mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users . to make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible , they are usually built on a client server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub worlds . in each sub world , the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint , rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium . in such systems , the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user s viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability . specifically , performing real time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub millions of active users are moving and interacting . we recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem , and hence we map the moving geometry

relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the cbir systems . the user s labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images . however , the top returned images may not be the most informative ones . the challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative ( i . e . , improve the classifier the most ) if they were labeled and used as training samples . in this paper , we propose a novel active learning algorithm , called laplacian optimal design ( lod ) , for relevance feedback image retrieval . our algorithm is based on a regression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured ( or , labeled ) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space

improve performance by reducing the size of the index , if we compute the top results only from the pruned index we may notice a significant degradation in the result quality if a document should be

ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired payment bound . the ratio captures the extent to which the mechanism overpays , relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction . in this paper , we propose a new truthful polynomial time auction for the vertex cover problem and bound its frugality ratio . we show that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible worst case bound this is the first auction for this problem to have these properties . moreover , we show how to transform any truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation ratio . also , we consider two natural modifications of the definition of karlin et al . , and we analyse the properties of the resulting payment bounds , such as monotonicity , computational hardness , and robustness with respect to the draw resolution rule . we study the relationships between the different payment bounds , both for general set systems and for specific set system auctions , such as path auctions and vertex cover auctions . we use these new definitions in the proof of our main result for vertex cover auctions via a bootstrapping technique , which may be of independent interest . categories and subject descriptors f . <digit> theory of computation analysis of algorithms and problem

on logical formulas . <sep> we develop a framework for trading in compound securities financial instruments that pay off contingent on the outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic . buying or selling securities which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit ( in expectation ) on subjective predictions . a compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events , enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk exposure , and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum . the tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents and auctioneer s optimization problems . we develop and motivate the concept of a compound securities market , presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples . we then analyze in detail the auctioneer s matching problem . we show that , with n events , the matching problem is co np complete in the divisible case and p <digit> complete in the indivisible case . we show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe language

are owned and operated by different parties , each with his own selfish goal . the field of algorithmic mechanism design handles the issue of private information held by the different parties in such computational settings . this paper deals with a complementary problem in such settings handling the hidden actions that are performed by the different parties . our model is a combinatorial variant of the classical principalagent problem from economic theory . in our setting a principal must motivate a team of strategic agents to exert costly effort on his behalf , but their actions are hidden from him . our focus is on cases where complex combinations of the efforts of the agents influence the outcome . the principal motivates the agents by offering to them a set of contracts , which together put the agents in an equilibrium point of the induced game . we present formal models for this setting , suggest and embark on an analysis of some basic issues , but leave many questions open

the forecasts . our results show that the class of all demand functions has unbounded complexity and therefore is not learnable , but that there exist interesting and potentially useful classes that

traditional mechanism design typically assumes isomorphism between the agents type and action spaces , in many situations the agents face strict restrictions on their action space due to , e . g . ,

threefold . first , we characterize sufficient conditions under which the information theoretically optimal social choice rule can be implemented in dominant strategies , and prove that any multilinear social choice rule is dominant strategy implementable with no additional cost . second , we identify necessary conditions for the optimality of action bounded mechanisms , and fully characterize the optimal mechanisms and strategies in games with two players and two alternatives . finally , we prove that for any multilinear social choice rule , the optimal mechanism with k actions incurs an expected loss of o ( <digit> k2 ) compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted action spaces . our results apply to various economic and computational settings , and we

analyzed under the assumption that the players choose their strategies simultaneously . however , this model is not always realistic . in many settings , one player is able to commit to a strategy before the other player makes a decision . such models are synonymously referred to as leadership , commitment , or stackelberg models , and optimal play in such models is often significantly different from optimal play in the model where strategies are selected simultaneously . the recent surge in interest in computing game theoretic solutions has so far ignored leadership models ( with the exception of the interest in mechanism design , where the designer is implicitly in a leadership position ) . in this paper , we study how to compute optimal strategies to commit to under both

games have been proposed as a game theoretic model of large scale distributed networks of non cooperative agents . when the number of players is large , and the underlying graph has low degree , they provide a concise way to represent the players payoffs . it has recently been shown that the problem of finding nash equilibria in a general degree <digit> graphical game with two actions per player is complete for the complexity class ppad , indicating that it is unlikely that there is any polynomial time algorithm for this problem . in this paper , we study the complexity of graphical games with two actions per player on bounded degree trees . this setting was first considered by kearns , littman and singh , who proposed a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes all nash equilibria of such games . the running time of their algorithm is exponential , though approximate equilibria can be computed efficiently . later , littman , kearns and singh proposed a modification to this algorithm that can find a single nash equilibrium in polynomial time . we show that this modified algorithm is incorrect the output is not always a nash equilibrium . we then propose a new algorithm that is based on the ideas of kearns et al . and computes all nash equilibria in quadratic time if the input graph is a path , and in polynomial time if it is an arbitrary graph of maximum degree <digit> . moreover , our algorithm can be used to compute nash equilibria of graphical games on arbitrary trees , but the running time can be exponential , even when the tree has bounded degree . we show that this is inevitable any algorithm of this type will take exponential time , even on bounded degree trees with pathwidth <digit> . it is an open question whether our algorithm runs in polynomial time on graphs with pathwidth <digit> , but we show that finding a nash equilibrium for a <digit> action graphical game in which the underlying graph has maximum degree <digit> and constant
