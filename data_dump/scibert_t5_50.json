<sep> in this research , a new type of manufacturing feature that is commonly observed in aircraft structural parts , known as ribs , is defined and implemented using the object oriented software

numerical control ( cnc ) operation experience and the machining knowledge are leveraged by analysing typical geometry interactions when generating machining tool paths where such knowledge and experience are abstracted as rules of process planning . then those abstracted machining process rules are implemented in a feature recognition algorithm on top of an existing and holistic attribute adjacency graph solution to extract seed faces , identify individual local rib elements and further cluster these newly identified local rib elements into groups for the ease of machining operations . out of the potentially different combinations of local rib elements , those optimised cluster groups are merged into the top level rib features . the enhanced recognition algorithm is presented in

video database is to partition the video sequences into shots . past approaches to this problem tend to confuse gradual shot changes with changes caused by smooth camera motions . this is in part due to the fact that camera motion has not been dealt with in a more fundamental way . we propose an approach that is based on a physical constraint used in optical flow analysis , namely , the total brightness of a scene point across two frames should remain constant if the change across two frames is a result of smooth camera motion . since the brightness constraint would be violated across a shot change , the detection can be based on detecting the violation of this constraint . it is robust because it uses only the qualitative aspect of the brightness constraint detecting a scene change rather than estimating the scene itself . moreover , by tapping on the significant know how in using this constraint , the algorithm 's robustness is further enhanced . experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of various algorithms . it was shown that our algorithm is less likely to interpret gradual camera motions as shot changes , resulting in a significantly better precision performance than most other algorithms .", "tail asymptotics for hol priority queues handling a large number of independent stationary sources . <sep> in this paper we study the asymptotics of the tail of the buffer occupancy distribution in buffers accessed by a large number of stationary independent sources and which are served according to a strict hol priority rule . as in the case of single buffers , the results are valid for a very general class of sources which include long range dependent sources with bounded instantaneous rates . we first consider the case of two buffers with one of them having strict priority over the other and we obtain asymptotic upper bound for the buffer tail probability for lower priority buffer . we discuss the conditions to have asymptotic equivalents . the asymptotics are studied in terms of a scaling parameter which reflects the server speed , buffer level and the number of sources in such a way that the ratios remain constant . the results are then generalized to the case of m buffers which leads to the source pooling idea . we conclude with numerical validation of our formulae against simulations which show that the asymptotic bounds are tight . we also show that the commonly suggested reduced service rate approximation can give extremely low estimates .", "a variant of parallel plane sweep algorithm for

our approach is made computationally tractable by assuming that each of the models is deterministic , by which we mean that a data point is associated to only a single latent state . the resulting algorithm is a variant of the support vector machine learning algorithm and in a limiting case the method is similar to the standard perceptron learning algorithm . we apply the method to two types of

lies in the fact that svpca is a learning algorithm without local minima because of the convexity of the semi definite optimization problems . to validate the performance of svpca , several experiments are conducted and numerical results have demonstrated that their generalization ability is better than that of regular pca . finally , some existing problems are also discussed .", "the neighborhood auditing tool a hybrid interface for auditing the umls . <sep> the umls 's integration of more than <digit> source vocabularies , not necessarily consistent with one another , causes some inconsistencies . the purpose of auditing the umls is to detect such inconsistencies and to suggest how to resolve them while observing the requirement of fully representing the content of each source in the umls . a software tool , called the neighborhood auditing tool ( nat ) , that facilitates umls auditing is presented . the nat supports neighborhood based auditing , where , at any given time , an auditor concentrates on a single focus concept and one of a variety of neighborhoods of its closely related concepts . typical diagrammatic displays of concept networks have a number of shortcomings , so the nat utilizes a hybrid diagram text interface that features stylized neighborhood views which retain some of the best features of both the diagrammatic layouts and text windows while avoiding the shortcomings . the nat allows an auditor to display knowledge from both the metathesaurus ( concept ) level and the semantic network ( semantic type ) level . various additional features of the nat that support the auditing process are described . the usefulness of the nat is demonstrated through a group of case studies . its impact is tested with a study involving a select group of auditors .

frequently have the difficulty that subboxes containing no solution can not be easily eliminated if they are close to the global minimum . this has the effect that near each global minimum , and in the process of solving the problem also near the currently best found local minimum , many small boxes are created by repeated splitting , whose processing often dominates the total work spent on the global search . this paper discusses the reasons for the occurrence of this so called cluster effect , and how to reduce the cluster effect by defining exclusion regions around each local minimum found , that are guaranteed to contain no other local minimum and hence can safely be discarded . in addition , we will introduce a method for verifying the existence of a feasible point close to an approximate local minimum . these exclusion regions are constructed using uniqueness tests based on the krawczyk operator and make use of first , second and third order information on the objective and constraint functions .", "learning about meetings . <sep> most people participate in meetings almost every day , multiple times a day . the study of meetings is important , but also challenging , as it requires an understanding of social signals and complex interpersonal dynamics . our aim in this work is to use a data driven approach to the science of meetings . we provide tentative evidence that ( i ) it is possible to automatically detect when during the meeting a key decision is taking place , from analyzing only the local dialogue acts , ( ii ) there are common patterns in the way social dialogue acts are interspersed throughout a meeting , ( iii ) at the time key decisions are made , the amount of time left in the meeting can be predicted from the amount of time that has passed , ( iv ) it is often possible to predict whether a proposal during a meeting will be accepted or rejected based entirely on the language ( the set of persuasive words ) used by the speaker .", "design and implementation of an expert interface system for integration of photogrammetric and geographic information systems for intelligent preparation and structuring of spatial data . <sep> preparation of spatial data for geographic information system ( gis ) simultaneously during feature digitizing process from photogrammetric models reduces data editing phases after feature digitizing process . therefore , the problems , caused by separating spatial data production process from preparation of this data , are overcome as far as possible . to achieve this purpose , specialty and expertise required for spatial data structuring and preparation for gis , should be available in an interface system which establishes a direct connection between photogrammetric and gis systems . in this case , when a user digitizes a feature from a photogrammetric model , decision making process about the method of editing , structuring , layering , and storing of the feature in gis database , can be carried out by such an interface system . thus , according to the capabilities of expert systems for modeling the knowledge and deduction methods of experts , generating an expert interface system between photogrammetric and gis systems , offers a suitable solution for this integration . in this paper , the capabilities of expert systems for intelligent spatial data structuring and

integration of photogrammetric and gis systems in order to take advantages of capabilities of both systems simultaneously as one integrated system , has been described .", "wevan a mechanism for evidence creation and verification in vanets . <sep> there are traffic situations ( e.g. incorrect speeding tickets ) in which a given vehicles driving behavior at some point in time has to be proved to a third party . vehicle mounted sensorial devices are not suitable for this matter since they can be maliciously manipulated . however , surrounding vehicles may give their vision on another ones behavior . furthermore , these data may be shared with the affected vehicle through vanets . in this paper , a vanet enabled data exchange mechanism called wevan is presented . the goal of this mechanism is to build and verify evidences based on surrounding vehicles ( called witnesses ) testimonies . due to the short range nature of vanets , the connectivity to witnesses may be reduced with

storage . <sep> flash based solid state storage ( flashsss ) has write oriented problems such as low write throughput , and limited life time . especially , flashssds have a characteristic vulnerable to random writes , due to its control logic utilizing parallelism between the flash memory chips . in this paper , we present a write optimized layer of dbmss to address the write oriented problems of flashsss in on line transaction processing environments . the layer consists of a write optimized buffer , a corresponding log space , and an in memory mapping table , closely associated with a novel logging scheme called incremental logging ( icl ) . the icl scheme enables dbmss to reduce page writes at the least expense of additional page reads , while replacing random writes into sequential writes . through experiments , our approach demonstrated up to an order of magnitude performance enhancement in i o processing time compared to the original dbms , increasing the longevity of flashsss by approximately a factor of two .", "wrinkle development analysis in thin sail like structures using mitc shell finite elements . <sep> we propose a method of modelling sail type structures which captures the wrinkling behaviour of such structures . the method is validated through experimental and analytical test cases , particularly in terms of wrinkling prediction . an enhanced wrinkling index is proposed as a valuable measure characterizing the global wrinkling development on the deformed structure . the method is based on a pseudo dynamic finite element procedure involving non linear mitc shell elements . the major advantage compared to membrane models generally used for this type of analysis is that no ad hoc wrinkling model is required to control the stability of the structure . we demonstrate our approach to analyse the behaviour of various structures with spherical and cylindrical shapes , characteristic of downwind sails over a rather wide range of shape and constitutive parameters . in all cases convergence is reached and the overall flying shape is most adequately represented , which shows that our approach is a most valuable alternative to standard techniques to provide deeper insight into the physical behaviour . limitations appear only in some very special instances in which local wrinkling related instabilities are extremely high and would require specific additional treatments , out of the scope of the present study .", "cliques , holes and the vertex coloring polytope . <sep> certain subgraphs of a given graph g restrict the minimum

resonance sensors based on mems technology . <sep> a miniaturized surface plasmon resonance ( spr ) chip has been developed for biomedical and chemical analysis with low cost and high performance . the techniques of bulk silicon micromachining and polymer replication were used to fabricate the kretschmann spr sensor composed of a polydimethylsiloxane ( pdms ) prism , a coupling glass and microchannels . the plasmon properties of thin metal films were investigated theoretically based on fresnel analysis , with optical boundary conditions pertaining to the surface plasmon resonance at the gold water and gold air interfaces . the theoretical results show that difference in the refractive index ( ri ) between the pdms prism and the coupling glass layer affect the precision of the spr angle and the spr curve . meanwhile , the period of the interference fringe attaching on the spr curve increases with an increase in wavelength and a decrease in the refractive index of the coupling glass layer . the gold thickness of <digit> nm is required while employing a fixed incident wavelength of <digit> nm , to achieve optimum spr excitation conditions and the sensor sensitivity . the

system optimization routine . <sep> an algorithm is sketched that generates all k maximal independent sets and all m minimal dependent sets of an arbitrary independence system , based on a set of cardinality n having at most <digit> ( n ) subsets . with access to an oracle that decides if a set is independent or not . because the algorithm generates all those sets , it solves the problems of finding all maximum independent and minimum dependent sets . those problems are known to be impossible to solve in general in time polynomial in n , k , and m , and they are np hard . the algorithm proposed and used is efficient in the sense that it requires only o ( nk m ) or o ( k nm ) visits to the oracle , the nonpolynomial part is only related to bitstring comparisons and the like , which can be performed rather quickly and , to some degree , in parallel on a sequential machine . this complexity compares favorably with another algorithm that is o ( n ( <digit> ) k ( <digit> ) ) . the design of a computer routine that implements the algorithm in a highly optimized way is discussed . the routine behaves as expected , as is shown by numerical experiments on a range of randomly
