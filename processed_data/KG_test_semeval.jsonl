constraints such as voice . thus , the loss of packets impairs the application level utility . for voice this utility impairment is twofold on one hand , even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted . on the other hand , some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets . we first develop an end to end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow . these packet level metrics are then linked to user level objective speech quality metrics . using this framework , we find that for low compressing sample based codecs ( pcm ) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well , whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact . for high compressing frame based codecs ( g . <digit> ) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories , though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state . contrary to sample based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however . we then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss . we designate these methods as intra flow loss recovery and control . at the end to end level , identification of packets sensitive to loss ( sender ) as well as loss concealment ( receiver ) takes place . hop by hop support schemes then allow to ( statistically ) trade the loss of one packet , which is considered more important , against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance . as both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission , a gain in user perception is obtainable . we show that significant

{"src": "design and implementation of a distributed content management system . <sep> the convergence of advances in storage , encoding , and networking technologies has brought us to an environment where huge amounts of continuous media content is routinely stored and exchanged between network enabled devices . keeping track of ( or managing ) such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data . storing live continuous media ( such as tv or radio content ) adds to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with . networked storage allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection to in fact be distributed across a network , making the task of content management all but impossible to deal with without a content management system . in this paper we present the design and implementation of the spectrum content management system , which deals with rich media content effectively in this environment . spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application to both stand alone and various networked scenarios . a unique aspect of spectrum is that it requires one ( or more ) retention policies to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system . this means that there are no eviction policies . content that no longer has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the system . different retention policies can easily be applied to the same content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication . this approach also allows spectrum to easily apply time based policies which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of live continuous media , to content . we not only describe the details of the spectrum architecture but also give typical use cases . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> . <digit> computer systems organization computer communication networks distributed systems h . <digit> . <digit> information systems information storage and retrieval systems and software general terms design , management", "tokenized_src": [408, 11, 4432, 13, 3, 9, 8308, 738, 758, 358, 3, 5, 32100, 8, 31098, 13, 15895, 16, 1606, 3, 6, 3, 35, 9886, 3, 6, 11, 7607, 2896, 65, 1940, 178, 12, 46, 1164, 213, 1450, 6201, 13, 7558, 783, 738, 19, 3860, 120, 5816, 11, 2509, 26, 344, 1229, 9367, 1904, 3, 5, 2627, 1463, 13, 41, 42, 5037, 3, 61, 224, 738, 3048, 4421, 788, 12, 8, 17224, 2908, 13, 331, 3, 5, 3, 17445, 619, 7558, 783, 41, 224, 38, 3, 17, 208, 42, 2252, 738, 3, 61, 617, 7, 12, 8, 11641, 16, 24, 48, 738, 65, 150, 168, 4802, 456, 42, 414, 11, 19, 2459, 1216, 1152, 5529, 12, 1154, 28, 3, 5, 1229, 15, 26, 1606, 1250, 738, 24, 19, 3, 6207, 120, 3, 4931, 38, 294, 13, 8, 337, 1232, 12, 16, 685, 36, 8308, 640, 3, 9, 1229, 3, 6, 492, 8, 2491, 13, 738, 758, 66, 68, 4586, 12, 1154, 28, 406, 3, 9, 738, 758, 358, 3, 5, 16, 48, 1040, 62, 915, 8, 408, 11, 4432, 13, 8, 10113, 738, 758, 358, 3, 6, 84, 3694, 28, 2354, 783, 738, 3762, 16, 48, 1164, 3, 5, 10113, 65, 3, 9, 15741, 4648, 24, 1250, 165, 917, 12, 321, 1518, 2238, 11, 796, 1229, 15, 26, 13911, 3, 5, 3, 9, 775, 2663, 13, 10113, 19, 24, 34, 2311, 80, 41, 42, 72, 3, 61, 14344, 3101, 12, 1581, 12, 334, 1466, 13, 738, 24, 19, 5816, 16, 8, 358, 3, 5, 48, 598, 24, 132, 33, 150, 3, 15, 29797, 3101, 3, 5, 738, 24, 150, 1200, 65, 3, 9, 14344, 1291, 2930, 12, 34, 19, 914, 3641, 45, 8, 358, 3, 5, 315, 14344, 3101, 54, 1153, 36, 2930, 12, 8, 337, 738, 2932, 6212, 3, 24962, 2178, 406, 146, 13555, 3, 5, 48, 1295, 92, 1250, 10113, 12, 1153, 1581, 97, 3, 390, 3101, 84, 33, 1857, 740, 6438, 831, 12, 1154, 28, 8, 1606, 13, 619, 7558, 783, 3, 6, 12, 738, 3, 5, 62, 59, 163, 5530, 8, 1030, 13, 8, 10113, 4648, 68, 92, 428, 4541, 169, 1488, 3, 5, 5897, 11, 1426, 20, 11815, 127, 7, 3, 75, 3, 5, 32101, 3, 5, 32101, 1218, 1002, 1470, 1218, 1901, 5275, 8308, 1002, 3, 107, 3, 5, 32101, 3, 5, 32101, 251, 1002, 251, 1606, 11, 24515, 138, 1002, 11, 889, 879, 1353, 408, 3, 6, 758, 1], "trg": "distribut content manag;spectrum content manag system;continu media storag;home network scenario;applic program interfac;content distribut network;uniform resourc locat;polici manag;network enabl dvr;high perform databas system;carrier grade spectrum manag", "tokenized_trg": [11266, 17, 738, 388, 9, 122, 32100, 10113, 738, 388, 9, 122, 358, 32100, 3, 14175, 783, 3, 7279, 9, 122, 32100, 234, 1229, 8616, 32100, 1120, 2176, 478, 1413, 89, 9, 75, 32100, 738, 11266, 17, 1229, 32100, 7117, 3, 60, 7, 1211, 75, 2072, 144, 32100, 3, 3233, 1294, 388, 9, 122, 32100, 1229, 3, 35, 15403, 3, 26, 208, 52, 32100, 306, 1912, 331, 4883, 358, 32100, 9568, 2769, 10113, 388, 9, 122, 1]}

multipoint communication across the internet . typically , nodes self organize with the goal of forming an efficient overlay tree , one that meets performance targets without placing undue burden on the underlying network . in this paper , we target high bandwidth data distribution from a single source to a large number of receivers . applications include large file transfers and real time multimedia streaming . for these applications , we argue that an overlay mesh , rather than a tree , can deliver fundamentally higher bandwidth and reliability relative to typical tree structures . this paper presents bullet , a scalable and distributed algorithm that enables nodes spread across the internet to self organize into a high bandwidth overlay mesh . we construct bullet around the insight that data should be distributed in a disjoint manner to strategic points in the network . individual bullet receivers are then responsible for locating and retrieving the data from multiple points in parallel . key contributions of this work include i ) an algorithm that sends data to different points in the overlay such that any data object is equally likely to appear at any node , ii ) a scalable and decentralized algorithm that allows nodes to locate and recover missing data items , and iii ) a complete implementation and evaluation of bullet running across the internet and in a large scale emulation environment reveals up to a factor two bandwidth improvements under a variety of circumstances . in addition , we find that , relative to tree based solutions , bullet reduces the need to perform expensive bandwidth probing . in a tree , it is critical that a node s parent delivers a high rate of application data to each child . in bullet however , nodes simultaneously receive data from multiple sources in parallel , making it less important to locate any single source capable of sustaining a high transmission rate . categories and subject descriptors c . <digit> .

who proposed a dynamic programming based algorithm that computes all nash equilibria of such games . the running time of their algorithm is exponential , though approximate equilibria can be computed efficiently . later , littman , kearns and singh proposed a modification to this algorithm that can find a single nash equilibrium in polynomial time . we show that this modified algorithm is incorrect the output is not always a nash equilibrium . we then propose a new algorithm that is based on the ideas of kearns et al . and computes all nash equilibria in quadratic time if the input
