{"src": "spatial gossip and resource location protocols . <sep> the dynamic behavior of a network in which information is changing continuously over time requires robust and efficient mechanisms for keeping nodes updated about new information . gossip protocols are mechanisms for this task in which nodes communicate with one another according to some underlying deterministic or randomized algorithm , exchanging information in each communication step . in a variety of contexts , the use of randomization to propagate information has been found to provide better reliability and scalability than more regimented deterministic approaches . in many settings , such as a cluster of distributed computing hosts , new information is generated at individual nodes , and is most interesting to nodes that are nearby . thus , we propose distance based propagation bounds as a performance measure for gossip mechanisms a node at distance d from the origin of a new piece of information should be able to learn about this information with a delay that grows slowly with d , and is independent of the size of the network . for nodes arranged with uniform density in euclidean space , we present natural gossip mechanisms , called spatial gossip , that satisfy such a guarantee new information is spread to nodes at distance d , with high probability , in o ( log1 steps . such a bound combines the desirable qualitative features of uniform gossip , in which information is spread with a delay that is logarithmic in the full network size , and deterministic flooding , in which information is spread with a delay that is linear in the distance and independent of the network size . our mechanisms and their analysis resolve a conjecture of demers et al . <digit> . we further
