this goal are ( <digit> ) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations ( <digit> ) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and ( <digit> ) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results . these problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask . the proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan . to obtain sufficient ( anatomical ) information for matching , two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol . a mutual information based algorithm was used as a registration technique . pet and ct data were obtained in seven patients . each patient had two ct scans and one pet scan . the datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching pet to ct sub <digit> , ct sub <digit> to ct sub <digit> , and ct sub <digit> to pet using the full circle consistency test . it was found that using our method , consistency could be obtained of <digit> mm and <digit> . <digit> degrees on average . the pet voxels used for registration were <digit> . <digit> mm , so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size . cropping the images ( removing the scanner bed from images ) did not improve the consistency
