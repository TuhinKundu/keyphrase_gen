[sep] orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been applied in broadband wireline and wireless systems for high data rate transmission where severe intersymbol interference ( isi ) always occurs. the conventional ofdm system provides advantages through conversion of an isi channel into isi free subchannels at multiple frequency bands. however, it may suffer from channel spectral nulls and heavy data rate overhead due to cyclic prefix insertion. previously, a new ofdm framework, the precoded ofdm, has been proposed to mitigate the above two problems through precoding and conversion of an isi channel into isi free vector channels. in this paper, we consider the application of the precoded ofdm system to efficient scalable video transmission. we propose to enhance the precoded ofdm system with adaptive vector channel allocation to provide stronger protection against errors to more important layers in the layered bit stream structure of scalable video. the more critical layers, or equivalently, the lower layers, are allocated vector channels of higher transmission quality. the channel quality is characterized by frobenius norm metrics based on channel estimation at the receiver. the channel allocation information is fed back periodically to the transmitter through a control channel. simulation results have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed scheme to noise and fading inherent in wireless channels", "i wap an intelligent wap site management system.

[sep] proposals for scalable quantum computing devices suffer not only from decoherence due to the interaction with their environment, but also from severe engineering constraints. here we introduce a practical solution to these major concerns, addressing solid state proposals in particular. decoherence is first reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits, then completely eliminated by an efficient set of decoupling pulse sequences. the same encoding removes the need for single qubit operations, which pose a difficult design constraint. we further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified empirically, in order to optimize the decoupling pulses", "social percolation and the influence of mass media.

[sep] a major issue in financial economics is the behavior of asset returns over long horizons. various estimators of long range dependence have been proposed. even though some have known asymptotic properties, it is important to test their accuracy by using simulated series of different lengths. we test r s analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis and periodogram regression methods on samples drawn from gaussian white noise. the dfa statistics turns out to be the unanimous winner. unfortunately, no asymptotic distribution theory has been derived for this statistics so far. we were able, however, to construct empirical ( i. e. approximate ) confidence intervals for all three methods. the obtained values differ largely from heuristic values proposed by some authors for the r s statistics and are very close to asymptotic values for the periodogram regression method", "simulation of evacuation processes using a bionics inspired cellular automaton. [sep] we present simulations of evacuation processes using a recently introduced cellular automaton model for pedestrian dynamics. this model applies a bionics approach to describe the interaction between the pedestrians using ideas from chemotaxis. here we study a rather simple situation, namely the evacuation from a large room with one or two doors. it is shown that the variation of the model parameters allows to describe different types of behaviour, from regular to panic. we find a non monotonic dependence of the evacuation times on the coupling constants. these times depend on the strength of the herding behaviour, with minimal evacuation times for some intermediate values of the couplings, i. e., a proper combination of herding and use of knowledge about the shortest way to the exit", "dynamical transition to periodic motions of a recurrent bus induced by nonstops. [sep] many bus stops when the recurrent bus passes some bus stops without stopping. the recurrent time ( one period ) is described in terms of a nonlinear map. it is shown that the recurrent bus exhibits the complex periodic behaviors. the dynamical transitions to periodic motions occur by increasing nonstops. the periodic motions depend on the property of an attractor of the nonlinear map. the period n of the attractor varies sensitively with the number of nonstops", "the two populations'cellular automata model with predation based on the penna. [sep] in penna's ( [digit] ) single species asexual bit string model of biological ageing, the verhulst factor has too strong a restraining effect on the development of the population. danuta makowiec gave an improved model based on the lattice, where the restraining factor of the four neighbours take the place of the verhulst factor. here, we discuss the two populations'penna model with predation on the planar lattice of two dimensions. a cellular automata model containing movable wolves and sheep has been built. the results show that both the quantity of the wolves and the sheep fluctuate in accordance with the law that one quantity increases while the other one decreases", "option pricing from path integral for non gaussian fluctuations. natural.

[sep] grammars ) from sequences of arbitrary input symbols by inventing abstract representations that accommodate unseen symbol sets as well as unseen but similar grammars. the neural network is shown to have the ability to transfer grammatical knowledge to both new symbol vocabularies and new grammars. analysis of the state space shows that the network learns generalized abstract structures of the input and is not simply memorizing the input strings. these representations are context sensitive, hierarchical, and based on the state variable of the finite state machines that the neural network has learned. generalization to new symbol sets or grammars arises from the spatial nature of the internal representations used by the network, allowing new symbol sets to be encoded close to symbol sets that have already been learned in the hidden unit space of the network. the results are counter to the arguments that learning algorithms based on weight adaptation after each exemplar presentation ( such as the long term potentiation found in the mammalian nervous system ) can not in principle extract symbolic knowledge from positive examples as prescribed by prevailing human linguistic theory and evolutionary psychology", "streaming, disruptive interference and power law behavior in the exit dynamics. [sep] we analyze the exit dynamics of pedestrians who are initially confined in a room. pedestrians are modeled as cellular automata and compete to escape via a known exit at the soonest possible time. a pedestrian could move forward, backward, left or right within each iteration time depending on adjacent cell vacancy and in accordance with simple rules that determine the compulsion to move and physical capability relative to his neighbors. the arching signatures of jamming were observed and the pedestrians exited in bursts of various sizes. power law behavior is found in the burst size frequency distribution for exit widths w greater than one cell dimension ( w > [digit] ). the slope of the power law curve varies with w from [digit]. [digit] ( w [digit] ) to [digit]. [digit] ( w [digit] ). streaming which is a diffusive behavior, arises in large burst sizes and is more likely in a single exit room with w [digit] and leads to a counterintuitive result wherein an average exit throughput q is obtained that is higher than with w [digit], [digit], or [digit]. for a two exit room ( w [digit] ), q is not greater than twice the yield of a single exit room. if the doors are not separated far enough ( < 4w ), q becomes even significantly less due to a collective slow down that emerges among pedestrians crossing in each other's path ( disruptive interference effect ). for the same w and door number, q is also higher with relaxed pedestrians than with anxious ones", "the influence of tollbooths on highway traffic. [sep] simulated by the nagel schreckenberg model. various types of toll collection are examined, which can be characterized either by a waiting time or a reduced speed. a first order phase transition is observed. the phase separation results a saturated flow, which is observed as a plateau region in the fundamental diagram. the effects of lane expansion near the tollbooth are examined. the full capacity of a highway can be restored. the emergence of vehicle queuing is studied. besides the numerical results, we also obtain analytical expressions for various quantities. the numerical simulations can be well described by the analytical formulas. we also discuss the influence on the travel time and its variance. the tollbooth increases the travel time but decreases its variance. the differences between long and short distance travelers are also discussed", "the bagsik oscillator without complex numbers.

[sep] size and the variance of its growth rate. the flatness of the relation is regarded as puzzling, in that it suggests that large firms are not much more stable than small firms. it has been suggested that the powerlaw nature of the relationship reflects the presence of some form of correlation of growth rates across the firm's constituent businesses. here, it is shown that a model of independent businesses which allows for the fact that these businesses vary in size, as modelled by a simple'partitions of integers'model, provides a good representation of what is observed empirically", "antipersistent markov behavior in foreign exchange markets. [sep] developed using high frequency ( tick by tick ) data. the antipersistent markov behavior of log price fluctuations of given size implies, in principle, the possibility of a statistical forecast. we introduce and measure the available information of the quote sequence, and we show how it can be profitable following a particular trading rule", "stock market dynamics. [sep] returns. moreover, we find that these properties are recurrent and are also present in invariant measures of low dimensional dynamical systems. thus, we propose that the returns are modeled by the first poincare return time of a low dimensional chaotic trajectory. this modeling, which captures the recurrent properties of the return fluctuations, is able to predict well the evolution of the observed statistical quantities. in addition, it explains the reason for which stocks present simultaneously dynamical properties and high uncertainties. in our analysis, we use data from the s p [digit] index and the brazilian stock telebras", "application of nonlinear time series analysis techniques to high frequency. [sep] in this work we have applied nonlinear time series analysis to high frequency currency exchange data. the time series studied are the exchange rates between the us dollar and [digit] other foreign currencies from within and without the euro zone. our goal was to determine if their dynamical behaviours were in some way correlated. the nonexistence of stationarity called for the application of recurrence quantification analysis as a tool for this analysis, and is based on the definition of several parameters that allow for the quantification of recurrence plots. the method was checked using the european monetary system currency exchanges. the results show, as expected, the high correlation between the currencies that are part of the euro, but also a strong correlation between the japanese yen, the canadian dollar and the british pound. singularities of the series are also demonstrated taking into account historical events, in [digit], in the euro zone", "modeling daily realized futures volatility with singular spectrum analysis.

[sep] photon statistics in a c. w. system has been observed in the mixing of a coherent field with a two photon source. their system has the advantage over other atomic transition based fluorescent systems. in this paper, we examine further the squeezing properties of higher order quantum fluctuations in one of the quadrature components of the combined field in this system. we demonstrate that efficient and lasting higher order squeezing effects could be observed with proper choice of the relative phase between the pump and coherent fields. this nonclassical feature is attributed to a constructive two photon interference. relationship between the second and higher order squeezing of the field is discussed", "modeling self consistent multi class dynamic traffic flow. [sep] traffic model derived from the vehicular boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model. the multilane domain is considered as a two dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model. the reason we consider a multilane domain as a two dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes, especially motorcyclists. the dispersion model, which is a nonlinear poisson equation, is derived from the car following theory and the equilibrium assumption. under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section, the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model. in addition, the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas kinetic model derived from the boltzmann equation. multiplying boltzmann equation by the zeroth, first and second order moment functions, integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules, we can derive continuity, motion and variance equation, respectively. however, the second order moment function, which is the square of the individual velocity, is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow", "mixture of experts classification using a hierarchical mixture model.

[sep] this paper provides a content analysis study of the application of world wide web marketing by the hotel industry. there is a lack of historical perspective on industry related web marketing applications and this paper attempts to resolve this with a two year follow up case study of the changing use of the web to develop different types of relationships. specifically, the aims are ( [digit] ) to identify key changes in the way hotels are using the web ( [digit] ) to look for evidence of the adoption of a relationship marketing ( rm ) model as a strategy for the development of hotel web sites and the use of new technologies and, ( [digit] ) to investigate the use of multimedia in hotel web sites. the development and strategic exploitation of the internet has transformed the basis of marketing. using the evidence from a web content survey this study reveals the way relationships are being created and managed within the hotel industry by its use of the web as a marketing tool. the authors have collected evidence by means of a descriptive study on the way hotels build and create relationships with their web presence delivering multimedia information as well as channel and interactive means of communication. in addition a strategic framework is offered as the means to describe the mechanism and orientation of web based marketing by hotels. the study utilizes a model by gilbert ( [digit] ) as a means of developing a measurement instrument to allow a content analysis of the current approach by hotels to the development of web sites. the results indicate hotels are aware of the new uses of web technology and are promoting hotel products in the global electronic market in new and sophisticated ways", "online auctions dynamic pricing and the lodging industry. [sep] rapidly being displaced by web site scripting, online intermediaries, and specialty brokers. businesses that pioneered internet usage relied on it as a sales and marketing alternative to predecessor product distribution channels. as such, web sites replace the traditional trading model to the internet. web enabled companies are popular because the medium renders the process faster, less costly, highly reliable, and secure. auction based models impact business models by converting the price setting mechanism from supplier centric to market centric and transforming the trading model from one to many to many to many. historically, pricing was based on the cost of production plus a margin of profit. traditionally, as products and services move through the supply chain, from the producer to the consumer, various intermediaries added their share of profit to the price. as internet based mediums of distribution become more prevalent, traditional pricing models are being supplanted with dynamic pricing. a dynamic pricing model represents a flexible system that changes prices not only from product to product, but also from customer to customer and transaction to transaction. many industry leaders are skeptical of the long run impact of online auctions on lodging industry profit margins, despite the fact pricing theory suggests that an increase in the flow of information results in efficient market pricing. the future of such endeavors remains promising, but controversial", "affine invariants of convex polygons.

[sep] among all algorithms based on wavelet transform and zerotree quantization, said and pearlman's ( [digit] ) set partitioning in hierarchical trees ( spiht ) algorithm is well known for its simplicity and efficiency. this paper deals with the real time implementation of spiht algorithm using dsp chip. in order to facilitate the implementation and improve the codec's performance, some relative issues are thoroughly discussed, such as the optimization of program structure to speed up the wavelet decomposition. spiht's high memory requirement is a major drawback for hardware implementation. in this paper, we modify the original spiht algorithm by presenting two new concepts number of error bits and absolute zerotree. consequently, the memory cost is significantly reduced. we also introduce a new method to control the coding process by number of error bits. our experimental results show that the implementation meets common requirement of real time video coding and is proven to be a practical and efficient dsp solution", "efficient computation of local geometric moments. [sep] as edge detection and texture segmentation. the main reason for this is that they are inherently integral based features, so that their use reduces the effect of uncorrelated noise. the computation of local moments, when viewed as a neighborhood operation, can be interpreted as a convolution of the image with a set of masks. nevertheless, moments computed inside overlapping windows are not independent and convolution does not take this fact into account. by introducing a matrix formulation and the concept of accumulation moments, this paper presents an algorithm which is computationally much more efficient than convolving and yet as simple", "adaptive image denoising using scale and space consistency. [sep] based on image multiresolution decomposition by a redundant wavelet transform. in our approach, edges are implicitly located and preserved in the wavelet domain, whilst image noise is filtered out. at each resolution level, the image edges are estimated by gradient magnitudes ( obtained from the wavelet coefficients ), which are modeled probabilistically, and a shrinkage function is assembled based on the model obtained. joint use of space and scale consistency is applied for better preservation of edges. the shrinkage functions are combined to preserve edges that appear simultaneously at several resolutions, and geometric constraints are applied to preserve edges that are not isolated. the proposed technique produces a filtered version of the original image, where homogeneous regions appear separated by well defined edges. possible applications include image presegmentation, and image denoising", "tracking nonparameterized object contours in video. [sep] transform of the edge map is used as an edge indicator function for contour detection. using the concept of topographical distance, the watershed segmentation can be formulated as a minimization. this new viewpoint gives a way to combine the results of the watershed algorithm on different surfaces. in particular, our algorithm determines the contour as a combination of the current edge map and the contour, predicted from the tracking result in the previous frame. we also show that the problem of background clutter can be relaxed by taking the object motion into account. the compensation with object motion allows to detect and remove spurious edges in background. the experimental results confirm the expected advantages of the proposed method over the existing approaches", "multilayered image representation application to image compression. [sep] and image compression. we describe a new multilayered representation technique for images. an image is parsed into a superposition of coherent layers piecewise smooth regions layer, textures layer, etc. the multilayered decomposition algorithm consists in a cascade of compressions applied successively to the image itself and to the residuals that resulted from the previous compressions. during each iteration of the algorithm, we code the residual part in a lossy way we only retain the most significant structures of the residual part, which results in a sparse representation. each layer is encoded independently with a different transform, or basis, at a different bitrate, and the combination of the compressed layers can always be reconstructed in a meaningful way. the strength of the multilayer approach comes from the fact that different sets of basis functions complement each others some of the basis functions will give reasonable account of the large trend of the data, while others will catch the local transients, or the oscillatory patterns. this multilayered representation has a lot of beautiful applications in image understanding, and image and video coding. we have implemented the algorithm and we have studied its capabilities", "combining spatial and scale space techniques for edge detection to provide a. [sep] new methods for detecting edges in an image using spatial and scale space domains are proposed. a priori knowledge about geometrical characteristics of edges is used to assign a probability factor to the chance of any pixel being on an edge. an improved double thresholding technique is introduced for spatial domain filtering. probabilities that pixels belong to a given edge are assigned based on pixel similarity across gradient amplitudes, gradient phases and edge connectivity. the scale space approach uses dynamic range compression to allow wavelet correlation over a wider range of scales. a probabilistic formulation is used to combine the results obtained from filtering in each domain to provide a final edge probability image which has the advantages of both spatial and scale space domain methods. decomposing this edge probability image with the same wavelet as the original image permits the generation of adaptive filters that can recognize the characteristics of the edges in all wavelet detail and approximation images regardless of scale. these matched filters permit significant reduction in image noise without contributing to edge distortion. the spatially adaptive wavelet noise filtering algorithm is qualitatively and quantitatively compared to a frequency domain and two wavelet based noise suppression algorithms using both natural and computer generated noisy images", "computational capacity of an odorant discriminator the linear separability of. [sep] we introduce and study an artificial neural network inspired by the probabilistic receptor affinity distribution model of olfaction. our system consists of n sensory neurons whose outputs converge on a single processing linear threshold element. the system's aim is to model discrimination of a single target odorant from a large number p of background odorants within a range of odorant concentrations. we show that this is possible provided p does not exceed a critical value p sub c and calculate the critical capacity alpha c p sub c n. the critical capacity depends on the range of concentrations in which the discrimination is to be accomplished. if the olfactory bulb may be thought of as a collection of such processing elements, each responsible for the discrimination of a single odorant, our study provides a quantitative analysis of the potential computational properties of the olfactory bulb. the mathematical formulation of the problem we consider is one of determining the capacity for linear separability of continuous curves, embedded in a large dimensional space. this is accomplished here by a numerical study, using a method that signals whether the discrimination task is realizable, together with a finite size scaling analysis", "lossy to lossless object based coding of [digit] d mri data.

[sep] selection of the best set of scales is problematic when developing signal driven approaches for pixel based image segmentation. often, different possibly conflicting criteria need to be fulfilled in order to obtain the best trade off between uncertainty ( variance ) and location accuracy. the optimal set of scales depends on several factors the noise level present in the image material, the prior distribution of the different types of segments, the class conditional distributions associated with each type of segment as well as the actual size of the ( connected ) segments. we analyse, theoretically and through experiments, the possibility of using the overall and class conditional error rates as criteria for selecting the optimal sampling of the linear and morphological scale spaces. it is shown that the overall error rate is optimized by taking the prior class distribution in the image material into account. however, a uniform ( ignorant ) prior distribution ensures constant class conditional error rates. consequently, we advocate for a uniform prior class distribution when an uncommitted, scale invariant segmentation approach is desired. experiments with a neural net classifier developed for segmentation of dynamic magnetic resonance ( mr ) images, acquired with a paramagnetic tracer, support the theoretical results. furthermore, the experiments show that the addition of spatial features to the classifier, extracted from the linear or morphological scale spaces, improves the segmentation result compared to a signal driven approach based solely on the dynamic mr signal. the segmentation results obtained from the two types of features are compared using two novel quality measures that characterize spatial properties of labelled images", "innovative phase unwrapping algorithm hybrid approach. [sep] treatment of a wrapped map. the proposed algorithm is especially effective for the unwrapping of speckle coded interferogram contour maps. in contrast to earlier unwrapping algorithms by region, we propose a local discontinuity restoring criterion to serve as the preprocessor or postprocessor of our hybrid algorithm, which makes the unwrapping by region much easier and more efficient. with this hybrid algorithm, a robust, stable, and especially time effective phase unwrapping can be achieved. additionally, the criterion and limitation of this hybrid algorithm are fully described. the robustness, stability, and speed of this hybrid algorithm are also studied. the proposed algorithm can be easily upgraded with minor modifications to solve the unwrapping problem of maps with phase inconsistency. both numerical simulation and experimental applications demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm", "strain contouring using gabor filters principle and algorithm. [sep] deformation contouring. however, from an engineering viewpoint, the derivatives of displacement, i. e., strain, are the desired parameter. thus there is a need to differentiate the displacement field. optical and digital methods have been proposed for this differentiation. optical methods provide contours that still need to be quantified, while digital methods suffer from drawbacks inherent in the digital differentiation process. we describe a novel approach of strain segmentation for the moire pattern using a multichannel gabor filter. appropriate filter design allows for user specific segmentation, which is essentially in engineering design and analysis", "novel denoising algorithm for obtaining a superresolved position estimation. [sep] achieve high positioning accuracy by applying a modified averaging operation. using the suggested approach, noise sensitivity of the positioning accuracy can be significantly reduced. this new improved algorithm can improve the performances of tracking systems used for military as well as civil applications. the concept is demonstrated theoretically as well as by optical experiment", "adaptive filtering for noise reduction in hue saturation intensity color space. [sep] in color image processing and analysis, the conversion formulas from the rgb color model to hsi are nonlinear and complicated in comparison with the conversion formulas of other color models. when an rgb image is degraded by random gaussian noise, this nonlinearity leads to a nonuniform noise distribution in hsi, making accurate image analysis more difficult. we have analyzed the noise characteristics of the hsi color model and developed an adaptive spatial filtering method to reduce the magnitude of noise and the nonuniformity of noise variance in the hsi color space. with this adaptive filtering method, the filter kernel for each pixel is dynamically adjusted, depending on the values of intensity and saturation. in our experiments we have filtered the saturation and hue components and generated edge maps from color gradients. we have found that by using the adaptive filtering method, the minimum error rate in edge detection improves by approximately [digit] %", "optical recognition of three dimensional objects with scale invariance using a. [sep] we present a real time method for recognizing three dimensional ( [digit] d ) objects with scale invariance. the [digit] d information of the objects is codified in deformed fringe patterns using the fourier transform profilometry technique and is correlated using a classical convergent correlator. the scale invariance property is achieved using two different approaches the mellin radial harmonic decomposition and the logarithmic radial harmonic filter. thus, the method is invariant for changes in the scale of the [digit] d target within a defined interval of scale factors. experimental results show the utility of the proposed method", "fully automatic algorithm for region of interest location in camera calibration. [sep] calibration used in computer vision inspection. an intelligent roi location algorithm based on the radon transform is developed to automate the calibration process. the algorithm remains robust even if the anchor target has a notable rotation angle in the target plane. this method functions well although the anchor target is not carefully positioned. several improvement methods are studied to avoid the algorithm's huge time space consumption problem. the algorithm runs about [digit] times faster if these improvement methods are applied. using this method fully automatic camera calibration is achieved without human interactive roi specification. experiments show that this algorithm can help to calibrate the intrinsic parameters of the zoom lens and the camera parameters quickly and automatically", "autofocus system for microscope. [sep] eccentric light beam approach with high resolution, wide focusing range, and compact construction. the principle is described. the theoretical formula of the eccentric light beam approach deduced can be applied not only to an object lens whose objective plane is just at the focal plane, but also to an object lens whose objective plane is not at the focal plane. the experimental setup uses a semiconductor laser device as the light source. the laser beam that enters into the microscope is eccentric with the main light axis. a defocused signal is acquired by a symmetrical silicon photocell for the change of the reflected light position caused by differential amplification and processed by a microprocessor. then the electric signal is power amplified and drives a dc motor, which moves a fine working platform to an automatic focus of the microscope. the result of the experiments shows a or [digit]. [digit] mu m precision of autofocusing for a range of or [digit] mu m defocusing. the system has high reliability and can meet the requirements of various accurate micro measurement systems", "design and implementation of a [digit] d mapping system for highly irregular shaped. [sep] the basic technology for a robotic system is developed to automate the packing of polycrystalline silicon nuggets into fragile fused silica crucible in czochralski ( melt pulling ) semiconductor wafer production. the highly irregular shapes of the nuggets and the packing constraints make this a difficult and challenging task. it requires the delicate manipulation and packing of highly irregular polycrystalline silicon nuggets into a fragile fused silica crucible. for this application, a dual optical [digit] d surface mapping system that uses active laser triangulation has been developed and successfully tested. one part of the system measures the geometry profile of a nugget being packed and the other the profile of the nuggets already in the crucible. a resolution of [digit] mm with [digit] khz sampling frequency is achieved. data from the system are used by the packing algorithm, which determines optimal nugget placement. the key contribution is to describe the design and implementation of an efficient and robust [digit] d imaging system to map highly irregular shaped objects using conventional components in context of real commercial manufacturing processes", "effective moving cast shadow detection for monocular color traffic image. [sep] for an accurate scene analysis using monocular color traffic image sequences, a robust segmentation of moving vehicles from the stationary background is generally required. however, the presence of moving cast shadow may lead to an inaccurate vehicle segmentation, and as a result, may lead to further erroneous scene analysis. we propose an effective method for the detection of moving cast shadow. by observing the characteristics of cast shadow in the luminance, chrominance, gradient density, and geometry domains, a combined probability map, called a shadow confidence score ( scs ), is obtained. from the edge map of the input image, each edge pixel is examined to determine whether it belongs to the vehicle region based on its neighboring scss. the cast shadow is identified as those regions with high scss, which are outside the convex hull of the selected vehicle edge pixels. the proposed method is tested on [digit] vehicle images taken under different lighting conditions ( sunny and cloudy ), viewing angles ( roadside and overhead ), vehicle sizes ( small, medium, and large ), and colors ( similar to the road and not ). the results indicate that an average error rate of around [digit] % is obtained while the lowest error rate is around [digit] % for large vehicles", "estimation of error in curvature computation on multi scale free form surfaces. [sep] surface is presented. this is achieved by convolving local parametrisations of the surface with [digit] d gaussian filters iteratively. in our technique, semigeodesic coordinates are constructed at each vertex of the mesh. smoothing results are shown for [digit] d surfaces with different shapes indicating that surface noise is eliminated and surface details are removed gradually. a number of evolution properties of [digit] d surfaces are described. next, the surface gaussian and mean curvature values are estimated accurately at multiple scales which are then mapped to colours and displayed directly on the surface. the performance of the technique when selecting different directions as an arbitrary direction for the geodesic at each vertex are also presented. the results indicate that the error observed for the estimation of gaussian and mean curvatures is quite low after only one iteration. furthermore, as the surface is smoothed iteratively, the error is further reduced. the results also show that the estimation error of gaussian curvature is less than that of mean curvature. our experiments demonstrate that estimation of smoothed surface curvatures are very accurate and not affected by the arbitrary direction of the first geodesic line when constructing semigeodesic coordinates. our technique is independent of the underlying triangulation and is also more efficient than volumetric diffusion techniques since [digit] d rather than [digit] d convolutions are employed. finally, the method presented here is a generalisation of the curvature scale space method for [digit] d contours. the css method has outperformed comparable techniques within the mpeg [digit] evaluation framework. as a result, it has been selected for inclusion in the mpeg [digit] package of standards", "restoration of broadband imagery steered with a liquid crystal optical phased. [sep] in many imaging applications, it is highly desirable to replace mechanical beam steering components ( i. e., mirrors and gimbals ) with a nonmechanical device. one such device is a nematic liquid crystal optical phased array ( lcopa ). an lcopa can implement a blazed phase grating to steer the incident light. however, when a phase grating is used in a broadband imaging system, two adverse effects can occur. first, dispersion will cause different incident wavelengths arriving at the same angle to be steered to different output angles, causing chromatic aberrations in the image plane. second, the device will steer energy not only to the first diffraction order, but to others as well. this multiple order effect results in multiple copies of the scene appearing in the image plane. we describe a digital image restoration technique designed to overcome these degradations. the proposed postprocessing technique is based on a wiener deconvolution filter. the technique, however, is applicable only to scenes containing objects with approximately constant reflectivities over the spectral region of interest. experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique", "one step digit set restricted modified signed digit adder using an incoherent. [sep] an efficient one step digit set restricted modified signed digit ( msd ) adder based on symbolic substitution is presented. in this technique, carry propagation is avoided by introducing reference digits to restrict the intermediate carry and sum digits to [digit], [digit] and [digit], [digit], respectively. the proposed technique requires significantly fewer minterms and simplifies system complexity compared to the reported one step msd addition techniques. an incoherent correlator based on an optoelectronic shared content addressable memory processor is suggested to perform the addition operation. in this technique, only one set of minterms needs to be stored, independent of the operand length", "two step integral imaging for orthoscopic three dimensional imaging with. [sep] we present a two step integral imaging system to obtain [digit] d orthoscopic real images. by adopting a nonstationary micro optics technique, we demonstrate experimentally the potential usefulness of two step integral imaging", "diffraction limit for a circular mask with a periodic rectangular apertures. [sep] a mask with periodic apertures imaging system is adopted very widely and plays a leading role in modern technology for uses such as pinhole cameras, coded imaging systems, optical information processing, etc. because of its high resolution, its infinite depth of focus, and its usefulness over a broad frequency spectra ranging from visible light to x rays and gamma rays. while the masks with periodic apertures investigated in the literature are limited only to far field diffraction, they do not take the shift of apertures within the mask into consideration. therefore the derivation of the far field diffraction for a single aperture can not be applied to a mask with periodic apertures. the far field diffraction formula modified for a multiaperture mask has been proposed in the past, the analysis remains too complicated to offer some practical guidance for mask design. we study a circular mask with periodic rectangular apertures and develop an easier way to interpret it. first, the near field diffraction intensity of a circular aperture is calculated by means of lommel's function. then the convolution of the circular mask diffraction with periodic rectangular apertures is put together, and we can present a simple mathematical tool to analyze the mask properties including the intensity distribution, blurring aberration, and the criterion of defining the far or near field diffraction. this concept can also be expanded to analyze different types of masks with the arbitrarily shaped apertures", "binocular model for figure ground segmentation in translucent and occluding. [sep] a fourier based solution to the problem of figure ground segmentation in short baseline binocular image pairs is presented. each image is modeled as an additive composite of two component images that exhibit a spatial shift due to the binocular parallax. the segmentation is accomplished by decoupling each fourier component in one of the resultant additive images into its two constituent phasors, allocating each to its appropriate object specific spectrum, and then reconstructing the foreground and background using the inverse fourier transform. it is shown that the foreground and background shifts can be computed from the differences of the magnitudes and phases of the fourier transform of the binocular image pair. while the model is based on translucent objects, it also works with occluding objects", "multispectral color image capture using a liquid crystal tunable filter. [sep] system consisting of a professional monochrome ccd camera and a tunable filter in which the spectral transmittance can be controlled electronically. we perform a spectral characterization of the acquisition system taking into account the acquisition noise. to convert the camera output signals to device independent color data, two main approaches are proposed and evaluated. one consists in applying regression methods to convert from the k camera outputs to a device independent color space such as ciexyz or cielab. another method is based on a spectral model of the acquisition system. by inverting the model using a principal eigenvector approach, we estimate the spectral reflectance of each pixel of the imaged surface", "iterative regularized least mean mixed norm image restoration. [sep] various types of noise. a mixed norm functional is introduced, which combines the least mean square ( lms ) and the least mean fourth ( lmf ) functionals, as well as a smoothing functional. two regularization parameters are introduced one to determine the relative importance of the lms and lmf functionals, which is a function of the kurtosis, and another to determine the relative importance of the smoothing functional. the two parameters are chosen in such a way that the proposed functional is convex, so that a unique minimizer exists. an iterative algorithm is utilized for obtaining the solution, and its convergence is analyzed. the novelty of the proposed algorithm is that no knowledge of the noise distribution is required, and the relative contributions of the lms, the lmf, and the smoothing functionals are adjusted based on the partially restored image. experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm", "motion estimation using modified dynamic programming. [sep] moving objects in a sequence of images is proposed. correspondence vector field computation is formulated as a matching optimization problem for multiple dynamic images. the proposed method is a heuristic modification of dynamic programming applied to the [digit] d optimization problem. motion vector field estimates using real movie images demonstrate good performance of the algorithm in terms of dynamic motion analysis", "centroid detection based on optical correlation. [sep] centroids of multiple objects in an input scene. the first method is based on the modulus of the moment function, the second method is based on squaring the moment function, and the third method works with a single intensity filter. these methods are invariant to changes in the position, orientation, and scale of the object and result in good noise smoothing performance. we use spatial light modulators ( slms ) to directly implement the input of the image and filter information for the purpose of these approaches. we present results showing simulations from different approaches and provide comparisons between optical correlation and digital moment based methods. experimental results corresponding to an optical correlator using slms for the centroid detection are also presented", "block truncation image bit plane coding.

[digit] bits pixel, whose performance is moderate in terms of compression ratio compared to other compression schemes such as discrete cosine transform ( dct ), vector quantization ( vq ), wavelet transform coding ( wtc ), etc. two kinds of overheads are required for btc coding bit plane and quantization values, respectively. a new technique is presented to reduce the bit plane overhead. conventional bit plane overhead is [digit]. [digit] bits pixel we decrease it to [digit]. [digit] bits pixel while maintaining the same decoded quality as absolute moment btc ( ambtc ) does for the lena image. compared to other published bit plane coding strategies, the proposed method outperforms all of the existing methods", "plenoptic image editing. [sep] designed to maintain consistency between multiple images of a physical 3d scene. the distinguishing feature of these operations is that edits to any one image propagate automatically to all other images as if the ( unknown ) 3d scene had itself been modified. the modified scene can then be viewed interactively from any other camera viewpoint and under different scene illuminations. the approach is useful first as a power assist that enables a user to quickly modify many images by editing just a few, and second as a means for constructing and editing image based scene representations by manipulating a set of photographs. the approach works by extending operations like image painting, scissoring, and morphing so that they alter a scene's plenoptic function in a physically consistent way, thereby affecting scene appearance from all viewpoints simultaneously. a key element in realizing these operations is a new volumetric decomposition technique for reconstructing an scene's plenoptic function from an incomplete set of camera viewpoints", "elimination of zero order diffraction in digital holography. [sep] image of digital holography is presented. in this method, the laplacian of a detected hologram is used instead of the hologram itself for numerical reconstruction by computing the discrete fresnel integral. this method can significantly improve the image quality and give better resolution and higher accuracy of the reconstructed image. the main advantages of this method are its simplicity in experimental requirements and convenience in data processing", "efficient two level image thresholding method based on bayesian formulation and. [sep] an efficient method for two level thresholding is proposed based on the bayes formula and the maximum entropy principle, in which no assumptions of the image histogram are made. an alternative criterion is derived based on maximizing entropy and used for speeding up the searching algorithm. five forms of conditional probability distributions simple, linear, parabola concave, parabola convex, and s function are employed and compared to each other for optimal threshold determination. the effect of precision on optimal threshold determination is discussed and a trade off precision epsilon [digit]. [digit] is selected experimentally. our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in speed from [digit] to [digit] times faster than the exhaustive search method", "adaptive digital watermarking using fuzzy logic techniques. [sep] society. we propose an adaptive digital watermarking scheme based on the human visual system model and a fuzzy logic technique. the fuzzy logic approach is employed to obtain the different strengths and lengths of a watermark by the local characteristics of the image in our proposed scheme. in our experiments, this scheme provides a more robust and imperceptible watermark", "optical encoding of color three dimensional correlation. [sep] distribution as the third dimension, has been shown to be useful for color pattern recognition tasks. nevertheless, 3d correlation can not be directly performed on an optical correlator, that can only process two dimensional ( 2d ) signals. we propose a method to encode 3d functions onto 2d ones in such a way that the fourier transform and correlation of these signals, that can be optically performed, encode the 3d fourier transform and correlation of the 3d signals. the theory for the encoding is given and experimental results obtained in an optical correlator are shown", "search for efficient solutions of multi criterion problems by target level. [sep] the target level method is considered for solving continuous multi criterion maximization problems. in the first step, the decision maker specifies a target level point ( the desired criterion values ) then in the set of vector evaluations we seek points that are closest to the target point in the chebyshev metric. the vector evaluations obtained in this way are in general weakly efficient. to identify the efficient evaluations, the second step maximizes the sum of the criteria on the set generated in step [digit]. we prove the relationship between the evaluations and decisions obtained by the proposed procedure, on the one hand, and the efficient ( weakly efficient ) evaluations and decisions, on the other hand. if the edgeworth pareto hull of the set of vector evaluations is convex, the set of efficient vector evaluations can be approximated by the proposed method", "computer processing of data on mental impairments during the acute period of.

[sep] we consider the behavior of four choice rules plurality voting, approval voting, borda count, and self consistent choice when applied to choose the best option from a three element set. it is assumed that the two main options are preferred by a large majority of the voters, while the third option gets a very small number of votes and influences the election outcome only when the two main options receive a close number of votes. when used to rate the main options, borda count and self consistent choice contain terms that allow both for the strength of preferences of the voters and the rating of the main candidates by voters who vote for the third option. in this way, it becomes possible to determine more reliably the winner when plurality voting or approval voting produce close results", "an inverse problem for a model of a hierarchical structure. [sep] parabolic equation. the model is applied to describe the functioning of a hierarchical structure it is also relevant for heat conduction theory. unique solvability of the inverse problem is proved", "self calibration from image derivatives. [sep] from image motion fields induced by a rigidly moving camera with unknown parameters, where the image formation is modeled with a linear pinhole camera model. the equations obtained show the flow to be separated into a component due to the translation and the calibration parameters and a component due to the rotation and the calibration parameters. a set of parameters encoding the latter component is linearly related to the flow, and from these parameters the calibration can be determined. however, as for discrete motion, in general it is not possible to decouple image measurements obtained from only two frames into translational and rotational components. geometrically, the ambiguity takes the form of a part of the rotational component being parallel to the translational component, and thus the scene can be reconstructed only up to a projective transformation. in general, for full calibration at least four successive image frames are necessary, with the 3d rotation changing between the measurements. the geometric analysis gives rise to a direct self calibration method that avoids computation of optical flow or point correspondences and uses only normal flow measurements. new constraints on the smoothness of the surfaces in view are formulated to relate structure and motion directly to image derivatives, and on the basis of these constraints the transformation of the viewing geometry between consecutive images is estimated. the calibration parameters are then estimated from the rotational components of several flow fields. as the proposed technique neither requires a special set up nor needs exact correspondence it is potentially useful for the calibration of active vision systems which have to acquire knowledge about their intrinsic parameters while they perform other tasks, or as a tool for analyzing image sequences in large video databases", "inverse problems for a mathematical model of ion exchange in a compressible ion.

[sep] the algorithmic complexity of the innermost loops that determine the complexity of algorithms in computational electromagnetics ( cem ) codes are analyzed according to their operation count and the impact of the underlying computer hardware. as memory chips are much slower than arithmetic processors, codes that involve a high data movement compared to the number of arithmetic operations are executed comparatively slower. hence, matrix matrix multiplications are much faster than matrix vector multiplications. it is seen that it is not sufficient to compare only the complexity, but also the actual performance of algorithms to judge on faster execution. implications involve fdtd loops, lu factorizations, and iterative solvers for dense matrices. run times on two reference platforms, namely an athlon [digit] mhz and an hp pa [digit] processor, verify the findings", "three dimensional geometrical optics code for indoor propagation.

[sep] x ray computed tomography ( ct ) images of patients bearing metal intracavitary applicators or other metal foreign objects exhibit severe artifacts including streaks and aliasing. we have systematically evaluated via computer simulations the impact of scattered radiation, the polyenergetic spectrum, and measurement noise on the performance of three reconstruction algorithms conventional filtered backprojection ( fbp ), deterministic iterative deblurring, and a new iterative algorithm, alternating minimization ( am ), based on a ct detector model that includes noise, scatter, and polyenergetic spectra. contrary to the dominant view of the literature, fbp streaking artifacts are due mostly to mismatches between fbp's simplified model of ct detector response and the physical process of signal acquisition. artifacts on am images are significantly mitigated as this algorithm substantially reduces detector model mismatches. however, metal artifacts are reduced to acceptable levels only when prior knowledge of the metal object in the patient, including its pose, shape, and attenuation map, are used to constrain am's iterations. am image reconstruction, in combination with object constrained ct to estimate the pose of metal objects in the patient, is a promising approach for effectively mitigating metal artifacts and making quantitative estimation of tissue attenuation coefficients a clinical possibility", "matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck area development of method and. [sep] positron emission tomography ( pet ) provides important information on tumor biology, but lacks detailed anatomical information. our aim in the present study was to develop and validate an automatic registration method for matching pet and ct scans of the head and neck. three difficulties in achieving this goal are ( [digit] ) nonrigid motions of the neck can hamper the use of automatic ridged body transformations ( [digit] ) emission scans contain too little anatomical information to apply standard image fusion methods and ( [digit] ) no objective way exists to quantify the quality of the match results. these problems are solved as follows accurate and reproducible positioning of the patient was achieved by using a radiotherapy treatment mask. the proposed method makes use of the transmission rather than the emission scan. to obtain sufficient ( anatomical ) information for matching, two bed positions for the transmission scan were included in the protocol. a mutual information based algorithm was used as a registration technique. pet and ct data were obtained in seven patients. each patient had two ct scans and one pet scan. the datasets were used to estimate the consistency by matching pet to ct sub [digit], ct sub [digit] to ct sub [digit], and ct sub [digit] to pet using the full circle consistency test. it was found that using our method, consistency could be obtained of [digit] mm and [digit]. [digit] degrees on average. the pet voxels used for registration were [digit]. [digit] mm, so the errors compared quite favorably with the voxel size. cropping the images ( removing the scanner bed from images ) did not improve the consistency of the algorithm. the transmission scan, however, could potentially be reduced to a single position using this approach. in conclusion, the represented algorithm and validation technique has several features that are attractive from both theoretical and practical point of view, it is a user independent, automatic validation technique for matching ct and pet scans of the head and neck, which gives the opportunity to compare different image enhancements", "fresh tracks food processing.

[sep] reaction rate on metabolite concentration taking the form of saturation kinetics. recently, it has been shown that this feature is associated with the phenomenon of loss of system coordination ( liu, [digit] ). in this paper, we study a system of ordinary differential equations representing a branched biochemical system of enzyme mediated reactions. we show that this system can become very sensitive to changes in certain maximum enzyme activities. in particular, we show that the system exhibits three distinct responses a unique, globally stable steady state, large amplitude oscillations, and asymptotically unbounded solutions, with the transition between these states being almost instantaneous. it is shown that the appearance of large amplitude, stable limit cycles occurs due to a false bifurcation or canard explosion. the subsequent disappearance of limit cycles corresponds to the collapse of the domain of attraction of the attracting set for the system and occurs due to a global bifurcation in the flow, namely, a saddle connection. subsequently, almost all nonnegative data become unbounded under the action of the dynamical system and correspond exactly to loss of system coordination. we discuss the relevance of these results to the possible consequences of modulating such systems", "a spatial rainfall simulator for crop production modeling in southern africa. [sep] set of spatial units in areas where long term meteorological records are available for a small number of sites only. the work forms part of a larger simulation model of the food system in a district of zimbabwe, which includes a crop production component for yields of maize, small grains and groundnuts. only a limited number of meteorological stations are available within or surrounding the district that have long time series of rainfall records. preliminary analysis of rainfall data for these stations suggested that intra seasonal temporal correlation was negligible, but that rainfall at any given station was correlated with rainfall at neighbouring stations. this spatial correlation structure can be modeled using a multivariate normal distribution consisting of [digit] related variables, representing dekadly rainfall in each of the [digit] wards. for each ward, log transformed rainfall for each of the [digit] dekads in the year was characterized by a mean and standard deviation, which were interpolated from surrounding meteorological stations. a covariance matrix derived from a distance measure was then used to represent the spatial correlation between wards. sets of random numbers were then drawn from this distribution to simulate rainfall across the wards in any given dekad. cross validation of estimated rainfall parameters against observed parameters for the one meteorological station within the district suggests that the interpolation process works well. the methodology developed is useful in situations where long term climatic records are scarce and where rainfall shows pronounced spatial correlation, but negligible temporal correlation", "an algorithm to generate all spanning trees with flow.

[sep] designed independent of the initial conditions are known to be sensitive to parameter variations and extraneous disturbances during the reaching phase. for second order systems this drawback is eliminated by using the moving switching line technique where the switching line is initially designed to pass the initial conditions and is subsequently moved towards a predetermined switching line. in this paper, we make use of the above idea of moving switching line together with the reaching law approach to design a discrete output feedback sliding mode control. the main contributions of this work are such that we do not require to use system states as it makes use of only the output samples for designing the controller. and by using the moving switching line a low sensitivity system is obtained through shortening the reaching phase. simulation results show that the fast output sampling feedback guarantees sliding motion similar to that obtained using state feedback", "when a better interface and easy navigation aren't enough examining the. [sep] an information architecture that allows users to easily navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes is often defined as a highly usable system. but usability in systems design goes beyond a good interface and efficient navigation. in this article we describe two database systems in a law enforcement agency. one system is a legacy, text based system with cumbersome navigation ( rms ) the newer system is a graphical user interface with simplified navigation ( copnet ). it is hypothesized that law enforcement users will evaluate copnet higher than rms, but experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than others will. we conducted two user studies. one study examined what users thought of rms and copnet, and compared rms experts'evaluations with nonexperts. we found that all users evaluated copnet as more effective, easier to use, and easier to navigate than rms, and this was especially noticeable for users who were not experts with the older system. the second, follow up study examined use behavior after copnet was deployed some time later. the findings revealed that evaluations of copnet were not associated with its use. if the newer system had a better interface and was easier to navigate than the older, legacy system, why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch we discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult, especially for those who are most adept at using the older system. implications for system design and usability are also discussed", "optimization of planning an advertising campaign of goods and services.

[sep] this article examines how the internet transforms collective action. current practices on the web bear witness to thriving collective action ranging from persuasive to confrontational, individual to collective, undertakings. even more influential than direct calls for action is the indirect mobilizing influence of the internet's powers of mass communication, which is boosted by an antiauthoritarian ideology on the web. theoretically, collective action through the otherwise socially isolating computer is possible because people rely on internalized group memberships and social identities to achieve social involvement. empirical evidence from an online survey among environmental activists and nonactivists confirms that online action is considered an equivalent alternative to offline action by activists and nonactivists alike. however, the internet may slightly alter the motives underlying collective action and thereby alter the nature of collective action and social movements. perhaps more fundamental is the reverse influence that successful collective action will have on the nature and function of the internet", "explanations for the perpetration of and reactions to deception in a virtual. [sep] cases of identity deception on the internet are not uncommon. several cases of a revealed identity deception have been reported in the media. the authors examine a case of deception in an online community composed primarily of information technology professionals. in this case, an established community member ( df ) invented a character ( nowheremom ) whom he fell in love with and who was eventually killed in a tragic accident. when other members of the community eventually began to question nowheremom's actual identity, df admitted that he invented her. the discussion board was flooded with reactions to df's revelation. the authors propose several explanations for the perpetration of identity deception, including psychiatric illness, identity play, and expressions of true self. they also analyze the reactions of community members and propose three related explanations ( social identity, deviance, and norm violation ) to account for their reactions. it is argued that virtual communities'reactions to such threatening events provide invaluable clues for the study of group processes on the internet", "the effects of asynchronous computer mediated group interaction on group. [sep] this article reports a study undertaken to investigate some of the social psychological processes underlying computer supported group discussion in natural computer mediated contexts. based on the concept of deindividuation, it was hypothesized that personal identifiability and group identity would be important factors that affect the perceptions and behavior of members of computer mediated groups. the degree of personal identifiability and the strength of group identity were manipulated across groups of geographically dispersed computer users who took part in e mail discussions during a [digit] week period. the results do not support the association between deindividuation and uninhibited behavior cited in much previous research. instead, the data provide some support for a social identity perspective of computer mediated communication, which explains the higher levels uninhibited in identifiable computer mediated groups. however, predictions based on social identity theory regarding group polarization and group cohesion were not supported. possible explanations for this are discussed and further research is suggested to resolve these discrepancies", "online longitudinal survey research viability and participation.

[sep] method utilizes a simple encoding scheme which can represent both compounds and variables used to construct a qsar qspr model. a genetic algorithm is then utilized to simultaneously optimize the encoded variables that include both descriptors and compound subsets. the gas method generates multiple models each applying to a subset of the compounds. typically the subsets represent clusters with different chemotypes. also a procedure based on molecular similarity is presented to determine which model should be applied to a given test set compound. the variable selection method implemented in gas has been tested and compared using the selwood data set ( n [digit] compounds nu [digit] descriptors ). the results showed that the method is comparable to other published methods. the subset selection method implemented in gas has been first tested using an artificial data set ( n [digit] points nu [digit] descriptor ) to examine its ability to subset data points and second applied to analyze the xlogp data set ( n [digit] compounds nu [digit] descriptors ). the method is able to correctly identify artificial data points belonging to various subsets. the analysis of the xlogp data set shows that the subset selection method can be useful in improving a qsar qspr model when the variable selection method fails", "a formal model of computing with words. [sep] are generalizations of classical automata where the knowledge about the system's next state is vague or uncertain. it is worth noting that like classical automata, fuzzy automata can only process strings of input symbols. therefore, such fuzzy automata are still ( abstract ) devices for computing with values, although a certain vagueness or uncertainty are involved in the process of computation. we introduce a new kind of fuzzy automata whose inputs are instead strings of fuzzy subsets of the input alphabet. these new fuzzy automata may serve as formal models of computing with words. we establish an extension principle from computing with values to computing with words. this principle indicates that computing with words can be implemented with computing with values with the price of a big amount of extra computations", "using molecular equivalence numbers to visually explore structural features. [sep] a molecular equivalence number ( meqnum ) classifies a molecule with respect to a class of structural features or topological shapes such as its cyclic system or its set of functional groups. meqnums can be used to organize molecular structures into nonoverlapping, yet highly relatable classes. we illustrate the construction of some different types of meqnums and present via examples some methods of comparing diverse chemical libraries based on meqnums. in the examples we compare a library which is a random sample from the mdl drug data report ( mddr ) with a library which is a random sample from the available chemical directory ( acd ). in our analyses, we discover some interesting features of the topological shape of a molecule and its set of functional groups that are strongly linked with compounds occurring in the mddr but not in the acd. we also illustrate the utility of molecular equivalence indices in delineating the structural domain over which an sar conclusion is valid", "on the use of neural network ensembles in qsar and qspr. [sep] methods have not been widely adopted in structure activity and structure property correlation. neural networks are inherently unstable, in that small changes in the training set and or training parameters can lead to large changes in their generalization performance. recent research has shown that by capitalizing on the diversity of the individual models, ensemble techniques can minimize uncertainty and produce more stable and accurate predictors. in this work, we present a critical assessment of the most common ensemble technique known as bootstrap aggregation, or bagging, as applied to qsar and qspr. although aggregation does offer definitive advantages, we demonstrate that bagging may not be the best possible choice and that simpler techniques such as retraining with the full sample can often produce superior results. these findings are rationalized using krogh and vedelsby's ( [digit] ) decomposition of the generalization error into a term that measures the average generalization performance of the individual networks and a term that measures the diversity among them. for networks that are designed to resist over fitting, the benefits of aggregation are clear but not overwhelming", "median partitioning a novel method for the selection of representative subsets. [sep] a method termed median partitioning ( mp ) has been developed to select diverse sets of molecules from large compound pools. unlike many other methods for subset selection, the mp approach does not depend on pairwise comparison of molecules and can therefore be applied to very large compound collections. the only time limiting step is the calculation of molecular descriptors for database compounds. mp employs arrays of property descriptors with little correlation to divide large compound pools into partitions from which representative molecules can be selected. in each of n subsequent steps, a population of molecules is divided into subpopulations above and below the median value of a property descriptor until a desired number of [digit] sup n partitions are obtained. for descriptor evaluation and selection, an entropy formulation was embedded in a genetic algorithm. mp has been applied to generate a subset of the available chemicals directory, and the results have been compared with cell based partitioning", "chemical information based scaling of molecular descriptors a universal. [sep] scaling is a difficult issue for any analysis of chemical properties or molecular topology when disparate descriptors are involved. to compare properties across different data sets, a common scale must be defined. using several publicly available databases ( acd, cmc, mddr, and nci ) as a basis, we propose to define chemically meaningful scales for a number of molecular properties and topology descriptors. these chemically derived scaling functions have several advantages. first, it is possible to define chemically relevant scales, greatly simplifying similarity and diversity analyses across data sets. second, this approach provides a convenient method for setting descriptor boundaries that define chemically reasonable topology spaces. for example, descriptors can be scaled so that compounds with little potential for biological activity, bioavailability, or other drug like characteristics are easily identified as outliers. we have compiled scaling values for [digit] molecular descriptors. in addition the 10th and 90th percentile values for each descriptor have been calculated for use in outlier filtering", "mtd pls a pls based variant of the mtd method. ii. mapping ligand receptor. [sep] the pls variant of the mtd method ( t. i. oprea et al., sar qsar environ. res. [digit], [digit], [digit] [digit] ) was applied to a series of [digit] acetylcholinesterase hydrolysis substrates. statistically significant mtd pls models ( q sup [digit] between [digit]. [digit] and [digit]. [digit] ) are in agreement with previous mtd models, with the advantage that local contributions are understood beyond the occupancy nonoccupancy interpretation in mtd. a chemically intuitive approach further forces mtd pls coefficients to assume only negative ( or zero ) values for fragmental volume descriptors and positive ( or zero ) values for fragmental hydrophobicity descriptors. this further separates the various kinds of local interactions at each vertex of the mtd hypermolecule, making this method suitable for medicinal chemistry synthesis planning", "prediction of ultraviolet spectral absorbance using quantitative. [sep] high performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) with ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrophotometric detection is a common method for analyzing reaction products in organic chemistry. this procedure would benefit from a computational model for predicting the relative response of organic molecules. models are now reported for the prediction of the integrated uv absorbance for a diverse set of organic compounds using a quantitative structure property relationship ( qspr ) approach. a seven descriptor linear correlation with a squared correlation coefficient ( r sup [digit] ) of [digit]. [digit] is reported for a data set of [digit]. compounds. using the sum of zindo oscillator strengths in the integration range as an additional descriptor allowed reduction in the number of descriptors producing a robust model for [digit] compounds with five descriptors and a squared correlation coefficient [digit]. [digit]. the descriptors used in the models are discussed with respect to the physical nature of the uv absorption process", "assessment of the macrocyclic effect for the complexation of crown ethers with. [sep] the substructural molecular fragments method ( solov'ev, v. p. varnek, a. a. wipff, g. j. chem. inf. comput. sci. [digit], [digit], [digit] [digit] ) was applied to assess stability constants ( logk ) of the complexes of crown ethers, polyethers, and glymes with na sup, k sup, and cs sup in methanol. one hundred forty seven computational models including different fragment sets coupled with linear or nonlinear fitting equations were applied for the data sets containing [digit] ( na sup ), [digit] ( k sup ), and [digit] ( cs sup ) compounds. to account for the macrocyclic effect for crown ethers, an additional cyclicity descriptor was used. predicted stability constants both for macrocyclic compounds and for their open chain analogues are in good agreement with the experimental data reported earlier and with those studied experimentally in this work. the macrocyclic effect as a function of cation and ligand is quantitatively estimated for all studied crown ethers", "improving the predicting power of partial order based qsars through linear. [sep] partial order theory ( pot ) is an attractive and operationally simple method that allows ordering of compounds, based on selected structural and or electronic descriptors ( modeled order ), or based on their end points, e. g., solubility ( experimental order ). if the modeled order resembles the experimental order, compounds that are not experimentally investigated can be assigned a position in the model that eventually might lead to a prediction of an end point value. however, in the application of pot in quantitative structure activity relationship modeling, only the compounds directly comparable to the noninvestigated compounds are applied. to explore the possibilities of improving the methodology, the theory is extended by application of the so called linear extensions of the model order. the study show that partial ordering combined with linear extensions appears as a promising tool providing probability distribution curves in the range of possible end point values for compounds not being experimentally investigated", "novel ze isomerism descriptors derived from molecular topology and their. [sep] we introduce several series of novel ze isomerism descriptors derived directly from two dimensional molecular topology. these descriptors make use of a quantity named ze isomerism correction, which is added to the vertex degrees of atoms connected by double bonds in z and e configurations. this approach is similar to the one described previously for topological chirality descriptors ( golbraikh, a., et al. j. chem. inf. comput. sci. [digit], [digit], [digit] [digit] ). the ze isomerism descriptors include modified molecular connectivity indices, overall zagreb indices, extended connectivity, overall connectivity, and topological charge indices. they can be either real or complex numbers. mathematical properties of different subgroups of ze isomerism descriptors are discussed. these descriptors circumvent the inability of conventional topological indices to distinguish between z and e isomers. the applicability of ze isomerism descriptors to qsar analysis is demonstrated in the studies of a series of [digit] anticancer agents inhibiting tubulin polymerization", "computer mediated communication and university international students. [sep] the international students and faculty members of a small southwest university being surveyed and interviewed. the data collection procedure blends qualitative and quantitative data. a strong consensus was found that supports the study's premise that there is an association between the use of computer mediated communication ( cmc ) and teaching and learning performance of international students. both groups believe cmc to be an effective teaching and learning tool by increasing the frequency and quality of communication between students and instructors improving language skills through increased writing and communication opportunities allowing students and instructors to stay current and to compete effectively providing alternative teaching and learning methods to increase students'confidence in their ability to communicate effectively with peers and instructors and improving the instructors'pedagogical focus and questioning techniques", "uncertainty bounds and their use in the design of interval type [digit] fuzzy logic. [sep] we derive inner and outer bound sets for the type reduced set of an interval type [digit] fuzzy logic system ( fls ), based on a new mathematical interpretation of the karnik mendel iterative procedure for computing the type reduced set. the bound sets can not only provide estimates about the uncertainty contained in the output of an interval type [digit] fls, but can also be used to design an interval type [digit] fls. we demonstrate, by means of a simulation experiment, that the resulting system can operate without type reduction and can achieve similar performance to one that uses type reduction. therefore, our new design method, based on the bound sets, can relieve the computation burden of an interval type [digit] fls during its operation, which makes an interval type [digit] fls useful for real time applications", "entrepreneurs in action a web case model. [sep] compliance and control, characteristics which stifle the creative and entrepreneurial instincts of the children who are subjected to these tactics. the article explores a different approach to education, one that involves capturing the interest of the student through the use of problem and project based instruction delivered via the internet. called entrepreneurs in action, this program seeks to involve students in a problem at the outset and to promote the learning of traditional subject areas as a process of the problem solving activities that are undertaken. the program's details are explained, from elementary school through university level courses, and the authors outline their plans to test the efficacy of the program at each level", "factors contributing to preservice teachers'discomfort in a web based course. [sep] a report is given of a qualitative emergent design study of a science, technology, society interaction ( sts ) web enhanced course. students'discomfort during the pilot test provided insight into the intellectual scaffolding that preservice secondary science teachers needed to optimize their performance when required to develop understanding through open ended inquiry in a web environment. eight factors identified contributed to student discomfort computer skills, paradigm shifts, trust, time management, thinking about their own thinking, systematic inquiry, self assessment, and scientific discourse. these factors suggested developing understanding through inquiry by conducting a self designed, open ended, systematic inquiry required autonomous learning involving metacognitive skills and time management skills. to the extent in which students either came into the course with this scaffolding, or developed it during the course, they were successful in learning about sts and its relationship to science teaching. changes in the web site made to accommodate learners'needs as they surfaced are described", "recommendations for implementing internet inquiry projects.

[sep] combinations. educators have observed that visuals enhance learning which suggests that multimedia presentations should be superior to text only and text with static pictures in facilitating optimal human information processing and, therefore, comprehension. the article reports the findings from a [digit] ( text only, overhead slides, and multimedia presentation ) [digit] ( high and low information complexity ) factorial experiment. subjects read a text script, viewed an acetate overhead slide presentation, or viewed a multimedia presentation depicting the greenhouse effect ( low complexity ) or photocopier operation ( high complexity ). multimedia was superior to text only and overhead slides for comprehension. information complexity diminished comprehension and perceived presentation quality. multimedia was able to reduce the negative impact of information complexity on comprehension and increase the extent of sustained attention to the presentation. these findings suggest that multimedia presentations invoke the use of both the verbal and visual working memory channels resulting in a reduction of the cognitive load imposed by increased information complexity. moreover, multimedia superiority in facilitating comprehension goes beyond its ability to increase sustained attention the quality and effectiveness of information processing attained ( i. e., use of verbal and visual working memory ) is also significant", "real time tissue characterization on the basis of in vivo raman spectra. [sep] dedicated software that can perform the necessary signal processing and subsequent ( multivariate ) data analysis, enabling clinically relevant parameters to be extracted and made available in real time. here we describe the design and implementation of a software package that allows for real time signal processing and data analysis of raman spectra. the design is based on automatic data exchange between grams, a spectroscopic data acquisition and analysis program, and matlab, a program designed for array based calculations. the data analysis software has a modular design providing great flexibility in developing custom data analysis routines for different applications. the implementation is illustrated by a computationally demanding application for the classification of skin spectra using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis", "loudspeaker voice coil inductance losses circuit models, parameter estimation,. [sep] when the series resistance is separated and treated as a separate element, it is shown that losses in an inductor require the ratio of the flux to mmf in the core to be frequency dependent. for small signal operation, this dependence leads to a circuit model composed of a lossless inductor and a resistor in parallel, both of which are frequency dependent. mathematical expressions for these elements are derived under the assumption that the ratio of core flux to mmf varies as omega sup n [digit], where n is a constant. a linear regression technique is described for extracting the model parameters from measured data. experimental data are presented to justify the model for the lossy inductance of a loudspeaker voice coil. a spice example is presented to illustrate the effects of voice coil inductor losses on the frequency response of a typical driver", "complexity transitions in global algorithms for sparse linear systems over. [sep] we study the computational complexity of a very basic problem, namely that of finding solutions to a very large set of random linear equations in a finite galois field modulo q. using tools from statistical mechanics we are able to identify phase transitions in the structure of the solution space and to connect them to the changes in the performance of a global algorithm, namely gaussian elimination. crossing phase boundaries produces a dramatic increase in memory and cpu requirements necessary for the algorithms. in turn, this causes the saturation of the upper bounds for the running time. we illustrate the results on the specific problem of integer factorization, which is of central interest for deciphering messages encrypted with the rsa cryptosystem", "noise effect on memory recall in dynamical neural network model of hippocampus. [sep] and aihara ( [digit] ) for the memory recall of dynamical patterns in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex the noise effect is important since the release of transmitters at synaptic clefts, the operation of gate of ion channels and so on are known as stochastic phenomena. we consider two kinds of noise effect due to a deterministic noise and a stochastic noise. by numerical simulations, we find that reasonable values of noise give better performance on the memory recall of dynamical patterns. furthermore we investigate the effect of the strength of external inputs on the memory recall", "fuzzy polynomial neural networks hybrid architectures of fuzzy modeling. [sep] modeling architecture combining polynomial neural networks ( pnns ) and fuzzy neural networks ( fnns ). the development of the fpnns dwells on the technologies of computational intelligence ( ci ), namely fuzzy sets, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. the structure of the fpnn results from a synergistic usage of fnn and pnn. fnns contribute to the formation of the premise part of the rule based structure of the fpnn. the consequence part of the fpnn is designed using pnns. the structure of the pnn is not fixed in advance as it usually takes place in the case of conventional neural networks, but becomes organized dynamically to meet the required approximation error. we exploit a group method of data handling ( gmdh ) to produce this dynamic topology of the network. the performance of the fpnn is quantified through experimentation that exploits standard data already used in fuzzy modeling. the obtained experimental results reveal that the proposed networks exhibit high accuracy and generalization capabilities in comparison to other similar fuzzy models", "mems applications in computer disk drive dual stage servo systems.

[sep] varying from aviation communication to consumer audio. current anr systems use passive attenuation at high frequencies and loudspeaker based active noise control at low frequencies to achieve broadband noise reduction. this paper presents a novel anr headset in which the external noise transmitted to the user's ear via earshell vibration is reduced by controlling the vibration of the earshell using force actuators acting against an inertial mass or the earshell headband. model based theoretical analysis using velocity feedback control showed that current piezoelectric actuators provide sufficient force but require lower stiffness for improved low frequency performance. control simulations based on experimental data from a laboratory headset showed that good performance can potentially be achieved in practice by a robust feedback controller, while a single frequency real time control experiment verified that noise reduction can be achieved using earshell vibration control", "theoretical and experimental investigations on coherence of traffic noise. [sep] high rise buildings a method for theoretically calculating the coherence between sound pressure inside a rectangular room in a high rise building and that outside the open window of the room is proposed. the traffic noise transmitted into a room is generally dominated by low frequency components, to which active noise control ( anc ) technology may find an application. however, good coherence between reference and error signals is essential for an effective noise reduction and should be checked first. based on traffic noise prediction methods, wave theory, and mode coupling theory, the results of this paper enabled one to determine the potentials and limitations of anc used to reduce such a transmission. experimental coherence results are shown for two similar, empty rectangular rooms located on the 17th and 30th floors of a [digit] floor high rise building. the calculated results with the proposed method are generally in good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrate the usefulness of the method for predicting the coherence", "high density remote storage the ohio state university libraries depository.

[sep] inductive process. although top level goals, user attributes and available content are periodically considered, the process involves bottom up design activities. ia is inductive partly because it lacks internal theory, and partly because it is an activity that supports emergent phenomena ( user experiences ) from basic design components. the nature of ia design is well described by constructive induction ( ci ), a design process that involves locating the best representational framework for the design problem, identifying a solution within that framework and translating it back to the design problem at hand. the future of ia, if it remains inductive or develops a body of theory ( or both ), is considered", "information architecture for the web the ia matrix approach to designing. [sep] the article presents a matrix that can serve as a tool for designing the information architecture of a web portal in a logical and systematic manner. the information architect begins by inputting the portal's objective, target user, and target content. the matrix then determines the most appropriate information architecture attributes for the portal by filling in the applied information architecture portion of the matrix. the article discusses how the matrix works using the example of a children's web portal to provide access to museum information", "information architecture notes toward a new curriculum. [sep] professional practice. however, if it is to become a profession, it must develop a means of educating new information architects. lessons from other fields suggest that professional education typically evolves along a predictable path, from apprenticeships to trade schools to college and university level education. information architecture education may develop more quickly to meet the growing demands of the information society. several pedagogical approaches employed in other fields may be adopted for information architecture education, as long as the resulting curricula provide an interdisciplinary approach and balance instruction in technical and design skills with consideration of theoretical concepts. key content areas are information organization, graphic. design, computer science, user and usability studies, and communication. certain logistics must be worked out, including where information architecture studies should be housed and what kinds of degrees should be offered and at what levels. the successful information architecture curriculum will be flexible and adaptable in order to meet the changing needs of students and the marketplace", "information architecture in jasist just where did we come from. [sep] has been simultaneously drawn out yet rapid. those with an eye on history are quick to point to wurman's [digit] use of the term architecture of information, but it has only been in the last [digit] years that ia has become the source of sufficient interest for people to label themselves professionally as information architects. the impetus for this recent emergence of ia can be traced to a historical summit, supported by asis t in may [digit] at boston. it was here that several hundred of us gathered to thrash out the questions of just what ia was and what this new field might become. at the time of the summit, invited to present a short talk on my return journey from the annual acm sigchi conference, i entered the summit expecting little and convinced that ia was nothing new. i left [digit] days later refreshed, not just by the enthusiasm of the attendees for this term but by ia's potential to unify the disparate perspectives and orientations of professionals from a range of disciplines. it was at this summit that the idea for the special issue took root. i proposed the idea to don kraft, hoping he would find someone else to run with it. as luck would have it, i ended up taking charge of it myself, with initial support from david blair. from the suggestion to the finished product has been the best part of [digit] years, and in that time more than [digit] volunteers reviewed over [digit] submissions", "the impact of the internet on public library use an analysis of the current. [sep] the potential impact of the internet on the public's demand for the services and resources of public libraries is an issue of critical importance. the research reported in this article provides baseline data concerning the evolving relationship between the public's use of the library and its use of the internet. the authors developed a consumer model of the american adult market for information services and resources, segmented by use ( or nonuse ) of the public library and by access ( or lack of access ) to, and use ( or nonuse ) of, the internet. a national random digit dialing telephone survey collected data to estimate the size of each of six market segments, and to describe their usage choices between the public library and the internet. the analyses presented in this article provide estimates of the size and demographics of each of the market segments describe why people are currently using the public library and the internet identify the decision criteria people use in their choices of which provider to use identify areas in which libraries and the internet appear to be competing and areas in which they appear to be complementary and identify reasons why people choose not to use the public library and or the internet. the data suggest that some differentiation between the library and the internet is taking place, which may very well have an impact on consumer choices between the two. longitudinal research is necessary to fully reveal trends in these usage choices, which have implications for all types of libraries in planning and policy development", "duality revisited construction of fractional frequency distributions based on. [sep] fractional frequency distributions of, for example, authors with a certain ( fractional ) number of papers are very irregular, and therefore not easy to model or to explain. the article gives a first attempt to this by as suming two simple lotka laws ( with exponent [digit] ) one for the number of authors with n papers ( total count here ) and one for the number of papers with n authors, n in n. based on an earlier made convolution model of egghe, interpreted and reworked now for discrete scores, we are able to produce theoretical fractional frequency distributions with only one parameter, which are in very close agreement with the practical ones as found in a large dataset produced earlier by rao ( [digit] ). the article also shows that ( irregular ) fractional frequency distributions are a consequence of lotka's law, and are not examples of breakdowns of this famous historical law", "relevance of web documents ghosts consensus method.

[sep] reliable products is one of the great challenges. by using a resolution iii experiment together with degradation test, tseng et al. ( [digit] ) presented a case study of improving the reliability of fluorescent lamps. however, in conducting such an experiment, they did not address the problem of how to choose the optimal settings of variables, such as sample size, inspection frequency, and termination time for each run, which are influential to the correct identification of significant factors and the experimental cost. assuming that the product's degradation paths satisfy wiener processes, this paper proposes a systematic approach to the aforementioned problem. first, an identification rule is proposed. next, under the constraints of a minimum probability of correct decision and a maximum probability of incorrect decision of the proposed identification rule, the optimum test plan can be obtained by minimizing the total experimental cost. an example is provided to illustrate the proposed method", "analysis and efficient implementation of a linguistic fuzzy c means. [sep] vectors of fuzzy numbers as inputs. this algorithm is based on the extension principle and the decomposition theorem. it turns out that using the extension principle to extend the capability of the standard membership update equation to deal with a linguistic vector has a huge computational complexity. in order to cope with this problem, an efficient method based on fuzzy arithmetic and optimization has been developed and analyzed. we also carefully examine and prove that the algorithm behaves in a way similar to the fcm in the degenerate linguistic case. synthetic data sets and the iris data set have been used to illustrate the behavior of this linguistic version of the fcm", "warranty reserves for nonstationary sales processes. [sep] warranty period, is of importance to the manufacturer. costs associated with replacement or repair of the product are usually drawn from a warranty reserve fund created by the manufacturer. considering a stochastic sales process, first and second moments ( and thereby the variance ) are derived for the manufacturer's total discounted warranty cost of a single sale for single component items under four different warranty policies from a manufacturer's point of view. these servicing strategies represent a renewable free replacement, nonrenewable free replacement, renewable pro rata, and a nonrenewable minimal repair warranty plans. the results are extended to determine the mean and variance of total discounted warranty costs for the total sales over the life cycle of the product. furthermore, using a normal approximation, warranty reserves necessary for a certain protection level, so that reserves are not completely depleted, are found. results and their managerial implications are studied through an extensive example", "a multimodal data collection tool using realbasic and mac os x.

[sep] javascript programs can be used to control web experiments. this technique is illustrated by an experiment that tested the effects of advice on performance in the classic probability learning paradigm. previous research reported that people tested via the web or in the lab tended to match the probabilities of their responses to the probabilities that those responses would be reinforced. the optimal strategy, however, is to consistently choose the more frequent event probability matching produces suboptimal performance. we investigated manipulations we reasoned should improve performance. a horse race scenario in which participants predicted the winner in each of a series of races between two horses was compared with an abstract scenario used previously. ten groups of learners received different amounts of advice, including all combinations of ( [digit] ) explicit instructions concerning the optimal strategy, ( [digit] ) explicit instructions concerning a monetary sum to maximize, and ( [digit] ) accurate information concerning the probabilities of events. the results showed minimal effects of horse race versus abstract scenario. both advice concerning the optimal strategy and probability information contributed significantly to performance in the task. this paper includes a brief tutorial on javascript, explaining with simple examples how to assemble a browser based experiment", "using latent semantic analysis to assess reader strategies. [sep] based on verbal protocols that utilized latent semantic analysis ( lsa ). students were given self explanation reading training ( sert ), which teaches strategies that facilitate self explanation during reading, such as elaboration based on world knowledge and bridging between text sentences. during a computerized version of sert practice, students read texts and typed self explanations into a computer after each sentence. the use of sert strategies during this practice was assessed by determining the extent to which students used the information in the current sentence versus the prior text or world knowledge in their self explanations. this assessment was made on the basis of human judgments and lsa. both human judgments and lsa were remarkably similar and indicated that students who were not complying with sert tended to paraphrase the text sentences, whereas students who were compliant with sert tended to explain the sentences in terms of what they knew about the world and of information provided in the prior text context. the similarity between human judgments and lsa indicates that lsa will be useful in accounting for reading strategies in a web based version of sert", "personality research on the internet a comparison of web based and traditional. [sep] students, faculty, and researchers have become increasingly comfortable with the internet, and many of them are interested in using the web to collect data. few published studies have investigated the differences between web based data and data collected with more traditional methods. in order to investigate these potential differences, two important factors were crossed in this study whether the data were collected on line or not and whether the data were collected in a group setting at a fixed time or individually at a time of the respondent's choosing. the visions of morality scale ( shelton and mcadams, [digit] ) was used, and the participants were assigned to one of four conditions in class web survey, in class paper and pencil survey take home web survey, and take home paper and pencil survey. no significant differences in scores were found for any condition however, response rates were affected by the type of survey administered, with the take home web based instrument having the lowest response rate. therefore, researchers need to be aware that different modes of administration may affect subject attrition and may, therefore, confound investigations of other independent variables", "implications of document level literacy skills for web site design. [sep] information on the web have placed a tremendous amount of information at the fingertips of millions of people. although most of this information is at least intended to be accurate, there is much that is rumor, innuendo, urban legend, and outright falsehood. this raises problems especially for students ( of all ages ) trying to do research or learn about some topic. finding accurate, credible information requires document level literacy skills, such as integration, sourcing, corroboration, and search. this paper discusses these skills and offers a list of simple ways that designers of educational web sites can help their visitors utilize these skills", "fuzzy control of multivariable process by modified error decoupling.

[sep] slow temperature control is a challenging control problem. the problem becomes even more challenging when multiple zones are involved, such as in barrel temperature control for extruders. often, strict closed loop performance requirements ( such as fast startup with no overshoot and maintaining tight temperature control during production ) are given for such applications. when characteristics of the system are examined, it becomes clear that a commonly used proportional plus integral plus derivative ( pid ) controller can not meet such performance specifications for this kind of system. the system either will overshoot or not maintain the temperature within the specified range during the production run. in order to achieve the required performance, a control strategy that utilizes techniques such as model predictive control, autotuning, and multiple parameter pid is formulated. this control strategy proves to be very effective in achieving the desired specifications, and is very robust", "numerical representation of binary relations with a multiplicative error. [sep] this paper studies the case of the representation of a binary relation via a numerical function with threshold ( error ) depending on both compared alternatives. the error is considered to be multiplicative, its value being either directly or inversely proportional to the values of the numerical function. for the first case, it is proved that a binary relation is a semiorder. moreover, any semiorder can be represented in this form. in the second case, the corresponding binary relation is an interval order", "a pretopological approach for structural analysis.

[sep] or adding a new index to an existing database since both of them should handle an enormous volume of data. in this paper, we propose an algorithm for batch constructing the b sup tree, the most widely used index structure in database systems. the main characteristic of our algorithm is to simultaneously process all the key values to be placed on each b tree page when accessing the page. this avoids the overhead due to accessing the same page multiple times, which results from applying the b tree insertion algorithm repeatedly. for performance evaluation, we have analyzed our algorithm in terms of the number of disk accesses. the results show that the number of disk accesses excluding those in the relocation process is identical to the number of pages belonging to the b sup tree. considering that the relocation process is an unavoidable preprocessing step for batch constructing of b sup trees, our algorithm requires just one disk access per b tree page, and therefore turns out to be optimal. we also present the performance tendency in relation with different parameter values via simulation. finally, we show the performance enhancement effect of our algorithm, compared with the one using repeated insertions through experiments", "synthetic simultaneity natural and artificial.

[sep] endowing an autonomous system like a robot with intelligent behavior is difficult for several reasons. first, behavior is such a wide topic that a general framework paradigm of inspiration must be chosen in order to obtain a consistent model. such a framework can be, for example, biological modeling or an artificial intelligence approach. second, a general framework is not sufficient to determine a fully specified program to be implemented in a robot. many choices, tuning and tests must be carried out before obtaining a robust system. a biological model is presented, based on the definition of cortex like automata, representing elementary functions in the perceptive, motor or associative domain. these automata are connected in a network whose architecture, functioning and learning rules are described in a cortical framework. second, the computational model derived from that biological model is specified. the way units exchange and compute variables through links is explained, with reference to corresponding biological elements. it is then easier to report experiments allowing an autonomous system to learn regularities of a simple environment and to exploit them to satisfy some internal drives. even if additional biological hints can be added, this model allow us to better understand how a biological model can be implemented and how biological properties can emerge from a distributed set of units", "nissan v. nissan trademark dispute.

[sep] linear approaches like the minimum norm least square algorithm show insufficient performance when it comes to estimating the activation time map on the surface of the heart from electrocardiographic ( ecg ) mapping data. additional regularization has to be considered leading to a nonlinear problem formulation. the gauss newton approach is one of the standard mathematical tools capable of solving this kind of problem. to our experience, this algorithm has specific drawbacks which are caused by the applied regularization procedure. in particular, under clinical conditions the amount of regularization can not be determined clearly. for this reason, we have developed an iterative algorithm solving this nonlinear problem by a sequence of regularized linear problems. at each step of iteration, an individual l curve is computed. subsequent iteration steps are performed with the individual optimal regularization parameter. this novel approach is compared with the standard gauss newton approach. both methods are applied to simulated ecg mapping data as well as to single beat sinus rhythm data from two patients recorded in the catheter laboratory. the proposed approach shows excellent numerical and computational performance, even under clinical conditions at which the gauss newton approach begins to break down", "bayesian nonstationary autoregressive models for biomedical signal analysis.

[sep] this paper presents a supervisory control scheme based on hybrid systems theory and fuzzy events detection. the fuzzy event detector is a linguistic model, which synthesizes complex relations between process variables and process events incorporating experts'knowledge about the process operation. this kind of detection allows the anticipation of appropriate control actions, which depend upon the selected membership functions used to characterize the process under scrutiny. the proposed supervisory control scheme was successfully implemented for an oxichlorination reactor in a vinyl monomer plant", "automated breath detection on long duration signals using feedforward. [sep] a new breath detection algorithm is presented, intended to automate the analysis of respiratory data acquired during sleep. the algorithm is based on two independent artificial neural networks ( ann sub insp and ann sub expi ) that recognize, in the original signal, windows of interest where the onset of inspiration and expiration occurs. postprocessing consists in finding inside each of these windows of interest minimum and maximum corresponding to each inspiration and expiration. the ann sub insp and ann sub expi correctly determine respectively [digit]. [digit] % and [digit]. [digit] % of the desired windows, when compared with [digit] [digit] inspirations and [digit] [digit] expirations detected by a human expert, obtained from three entire night recordings. postprocessing allowed determination of inspiration and expiration onsets with a mean difference with respect to the same human expert of ( mean or sd ) [digit] or [digit] ms for inspiration and [digit] or [digit] ms for expiration. the method proved to be effective in detecting the onset of inspiration and expiration in full night continuous recordings. a comparison of five human experts performing the same classification task yielded that the automated algorithm was undifferentiable from these human experts, failing within the distribution of human expert results. besides being applicable to adult respiratory volume data, the presented algorithm was also successfully applied to infant sleep data, consisting of uncalibrated rib cage and abdominal movement recordings. a comparison with two previously published algorithms for breath detection in respiratory volume signal shows that the presented algorithm has a higher specificity, while presenting similar or higher positive predictive values", "model selection in electromagnetic source analysis with an application to vefs. [sep] sources are required to describe the electroencephalogram or magnetoencephalogram adequately. model selection procedures ( msps ) or goodness of fit procedures give an estimate of the required number of sources. existing and new msps are evaluated in different source and noise settings two sources which are close or distant and noise which is uncorrelated or correlated. the commonly used msp residual variance is seen to be ineffective, that is it often selects too many sources. alternatives like the adjusted hotelling's test, bayes information criterion and the wald test on source amplitudes are seen to be effective. the adjusted hotelling's test is recommended if a conservative approach is taken and msps such as bayes information criterion or the wald test on source amplitudes are recommended if a more liberal approach is desirable. the msps are applied to empirical data ( visual evoked fields )", "time varying properties of renal autoregulatory mechanisms. [sep] autoregulation, time frequency and time scaling methods were applied to renal blood flow under broad band forced arterial blood pressure fluctuations and single nephron renal blood flow with spontaneous oscillations obtained from normotensive ( sprague dawley, wistar, and long evans ) rats, and spontaneously hypertensive rats. time frequency analyses of normotensive and hypertensive blood flow data obtained from either the whole kidney or the single nephron show that indeed both the myogenic and tubuloglomerular feedback ( tgf ) mechanisms have time varying characteristics. furthermore, we utilized the renyi entropy to measure the complexity of blood flow dynamics in the time frequency plane in an effort to discern differences between normotensive and hypertensive recordings. we found a clear difference in renyi entropy between normotensive and hypertensive blood flow recordings at the whole kidney level for both forced ( p < [digit]. [digit] ) and spontaneous arterial pressure fluctuations ( p < [digit]. [digit] ), and at the single nephron level ( p < [digit]. [digit] ). especially at the single nephron level, the mean renyi entropy is significantly larger for hypertensive than normotensive rats, suggesting more complex dynamics in the hypertensive condition. to further evaluate whether or not the separation of dynamics between normotensive and hypertensive rats is found in the prescribed frequency ranges of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms, we employed multiresolution wavelet transform. our analysis revealed that exclusively over scale ranges corresponding to the frequency intervals of the myogenic and tgf mechanisms, the widths of the blood flow wavelet coefficients fall into disjoint sets for normotensive and hypertensive rats. the separation of the scales at the myogenic and tgf frequency ranges is distinct and obtained with [digit] % accuracy. however, this observation remains valid only for the whole kidney blood pressure flow data. the results suggest that understanding of the time varying properties of the two mechanisms is required for a complete description of renal autoregulation", "the use of the spsa method in ecg analysis.

[sep] the ecology of the human intestinal microflora and its interaction with the host are poorly understood. though more and more data are being acquired, in part using modern molecular methods, development of a quantitative theory has not kept pace with this increase in observing power. this is in part due to the complexity of the system and to the lack of simulation environments in which to test what the ecological effect of a hypothetical mechanism of interaction would be, before resorting to laboratory experiments. the mimics project attempts to address this through the development of a cellular automaton for simulation of the intestinal microflora. in this paper, the design and evaluation of this simulator is discussed", "conformal mapping design tools for coaxial couplers with complex cross section. [sep] tool for the analysis and design of coaxial waveguides and couplers of complex cross section. an implementation based on the schwarz christoffel toolbox, a public domain matlab package, is applied to slotted coaxial cables and to symmetrical coaxial couplers, with circular or polygonal inner conductors and external shields. the effect of metallic diaphragms of arbitrary thickness, partially separating the inner conductors, is also easily taken into account. the proposed technique is validated against the results of the finite element method, showing excellent agreement at a fraction of the computational cost, and is also extended to the case of nonsymmetrical couplers, providing the designer with important additional degrees of freedom", "convolution based global simulation technique for millimeter wave photodetector. [sep] a fast convolution based time domain approach to global photonic circuit simulation is presented that incorporates a physical device model in the complete detector or mixer circuit. the device used in the demonstration of this technique is a gaas metal semiconductor metal ( msm ) photodetector that offers a high response speed for the detection and generation of millimeter waves. global simulation greatly increases the accuracy in evaluating the complete circuit performance because it accounts for the effects of the millimeter wave embedding circuit. device and circuit performance are assessed by calculating optical responsivity and bandwidth. device only simulations using gaas msms are compared with global simulations that illustrate the strong interdependence between device and external circuit", "accurate modeling of lossy nonuniform transmission lines by using differential. [sep] this paper discusses an efficient numerical approximation technique, called the differential quadrature method ( dqm ), which has been adapted to model lossy uniform and nonuniform transmission lines. the dqm can quickly compute the derivative of a function at any point within its bounded domain by estimating a weighted linear sum of values of the function at a small set of points belonging to the domain. using the dqm, the frequency domain telegrapher's partial differential equations for transmission lines can be discretized into a set of easily solvable algebraic equations. dqm reduces interconnects into multiport models whose port voltages and currents are related by rational formulas in the frequency domain. although the rationalization process in dqm is comparable with the pade approximation of asymptotic waveform evaluation ( awe ) applied to transmission lines, the derivation mechanisms in these two disparate methods are significantly different. unlike awe, which employs a complex moment matching process to obtain rational approximation, the dqm requires no approximation of transcendental functions, thereby avoiding the process of moment generation and moment matching. due to global sampling of points in the dqm approximation, it requires far fewer grid points in order to build accurate discrete models than other numerical methods do. the dqm based time domain model can be readily integrated in a circuit simulator like spice", "an unconditionally stable extended ( use ) finite element time domain solution of. [sep] this paper proposes an extension of the unconditionally stable finite element time domain ( fetd ) method for the global electromagnetic analysis of active microwave circuits. this formulation has two advantages. first, the time step size is no longer governed by the spatial discretization of the mesh, but rather by the nyquist sampling criterion. second, the implementation of the truncation by the perfectly matched layers ( pml ) is straightforward. an anisotropic pml absorbing material is presented for the truncation of fetd lattices. reflection less than [digit] db is obtained numerically over the entire propagation bandwidth in waveguide and microstrip line. a benchmark test on a microwave amplifier indicates that this extended fetd algorithm is not only superior to finite difference time domain based algorithm in mesh flexibility and simulation accuracy, but also reduces computation time dramatically", "low voltage dram sensing scheme with offset cancellation sense amplifier.
