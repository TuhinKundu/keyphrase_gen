discovery based on uddi. [sep] efficient discovery of grid services is essential for the success of grid computing. the standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids even though uddi has been the de facto industry standard for web services discovery, imposed requirements of tight replication among registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage. with the advent of grid computing the scalability issue of uddi will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids. in this paper we present our distributed web service discovery architecture, called dude ( distributed uddi deployment engine ). dude leverages dht ( distributed hash tables ) as a rendezvous mechanism between multiple uddi registries. dude enables consumers to query multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries.. based on preliminary prototype on planetlab, we believe that dude architecture can support effective distribution of uddi registries thereby making uddi more robust and also addressing its scaling issues. furthermore, the dude architecture for scalable distribution can be applied beyond uddi to any grid service discovery mechanism. categories and subject descriptors c2.

[sep] grids are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. one important problem in grid computing is resource selection, that is, finding an appropriate resource set for the application. another problem is adaptation to the changing characteristics of the grid environment. existing solutions to these two problems require that a performance model for an application is known. however, constructing such models is a complex task. in this paper, we investigate an approach that does not require performance models. we start an application on any set of resources. during the application run, we periodically collect the statistics about the application run and deduce application requirements from these statistics. then, we adjust the resource set to better fit the application needs. this approach allows us to avoid performance bottlenecks, such as overloaded wan links or very slow processors, and therefore can yield significant performance improvements. we evaluate our approach in a number of scenarios typical for the grid. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] best effort packet switched networks, like the internet, do not offer a reliable transmission of packets to applications with real time constraints such as voice. thus, the loss of packets impairs the application level utility. for voice this utility impairment is twofold on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted. on the other hand, some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets. we first develop an end to end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow. these packet level metrics are then linked to user level objective speech quality metrics. using this framework, we find that for low compressing sample based codecs ( pcm ) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact. for high compressing frame based codecs ( g. [digit] ) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. contrary to sample based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however. we then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss. we designate these methods as intra flow loss recovery and control. at the end to end level, identification of packets sensitive to loss ( sender ) as well as loss concealment ( receiver ) takes place. hop by hop support schemes then allow to ( statistically ) trade the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance. as both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission, a gain in user perception is obtainable. we show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] the convergence of advances in storage, encoding, and networking technologies has brought us to an environment where huge amounts of continuous media content is routinely stored and exchanged between network enabled devices. keeping track of ( or managing ) such content remains challenging due to the sheer volume of data. storing live continuous media ( such as tv or radio content ) adds to the complexity in that this content has no well defined start or end and is therefore cumbersome to deal with. networked storage allows content that is logically viewed as part of the same collection to in fact be distributed across a network, making the task of content management all but impossible to deal with without a content management system. in this paper we present the design and implementation of the spectrum content management system, which deals with rich media content effectively in this environment. spectrum has a modular architecture that allows its application to both stand alone and various networked scenarios. a unique aspect of spectrum is that it requires one ( or more ) retention policies to apply to every piece of content that is stored in the system. this means that there are no eviction policies. content that no longer has a retention policy applied to it is simply removed from the system. different retention policies can easily be applied to the same content thus naturally facilitating sharing without duplication. this approach also allows spectrum to easily apply time based policies which are basic building blocks required to deal with the storage of live continuous media, to content. we not only describe the details of the spectrum architecture but also give typical use cases. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] collaborative applications provide a shared work environment for groups of networked clients collaborating on a common task. they require strong consistency for shared persistent data and efficient access to fine grained objects. these properties are difficult to provide in wide area networks because of high network latency. buddycache is a new transactional caching approach that improves the latency of access to shared persistent objects for collaborative strong consistency applications in high latency network environments. the challenge is to improve performance while providing the correctness and availability properties of a transactional caching protocol in the presence of node failures and slow peers. we have implemented a buddycache prototype and evaluated its performance. analytical results, confirmed by measurements of the buddycache prototype using the multiuser [digit] benchmark indicate that for typical internet latencies, e. g. ranging from [digit] to [digit] milliseconds round trip time to the storage server, peers using buddycache can reduce by up to [digit] % the latency of access to shared objects compared to accessing the remote servers directly. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] this paper presents a simple and scalable framework for architecting peer to peer overlays called peer to peer  overlay ( or pro ). pro is designed for non interactive streaming applications and its primary design goal is to maximize delivered bandwidth ( and thus delivered quality ) to peers with heterogeneous and asymmetric bandwidth. to achieve this goal, pro adopts a receiver driven approach where each receiver ( or participating peer ) ( i ) independently discovers other peers in the overlay through gossiping, and ( ii ) selfishly determines the best subset of parent peers through which to connect to the overlay to maximize its own delivered bandwidth. participating peers form an unstructured overlay which is inherently robust to high churn rate. furthermore, each receiver leverages congestion controlled bandwidth from its parents as implicit signal to detect and react to long term changes in network or overlay condition without any explicit coordination with other participating peers. independent parent selection by individual peers dynamically converge to an efficient overlay structure. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] newly emerging game based application systems such as second  provide 3d virtual environments where multiple users interact with each other in real time. they are filled with autonomous, mutable virtual content which is continuously augmented by the users. to make the systems highly scalable and dynamically extensible, they are usually built on a client server based grid subspace division where the virtual worlds are partitioned into manageable sub worlds. in each sub world, the user continuously receives relevant geometry updates of moving objects from remotely connected servers and renders them according to her viewpoint, rather than retrieving them from a local storage medium. in such systems, the determination of the set of objects that are visible from a user s viewpoint is one of the primary factors that affect server throughput and scalability. specifically, performing real time visibility tests in extremely dynamic virtual environments is a very challenging task as millions of objects and sub millions of active users are moving and interacting. we recognize that the described challenges are closely related to a spatial database problem, and hence we map the moving geometry objects in the virtual space to a set of multi dimensional objects in a spatial database while modeling each avatar both as a spatial object and a moving query. unfortunately, existing spatial indexing methods are unsuitable for this kind of new environments. the main goal of this paper is to present an efficient spatial index structure that minimizes unexpected object popping and supports highly scalable real time visibility determination. we then uncover many useful properties of this structure and compare the index structure with various spatial indexing methods in terms of query quality, system throughput, and resource utilization. we expect our approach to lay the groundwork for next generation virtual frameworks that may merge into existing web based services in the near future. categories and subject descriptors c.

[sep] relevance feedback is a powerful technique to enhance contentbased image retrieval ( cbir ) performance. it solicits the user s relevance judgments on the retrieved images returned by the cbir systems. the user s labeling is then used to learn a classifier to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant images. however, the top returned images may not be the most informative ones. the challenge is thus to determine which unlabeled images would be the most informative ( i. e., improve the classifier the most ) if they were labeled and used as training samples. in this paper, we propose a novel active learning algorithm, called laplacian optimal design ( lod ), for relevance feedback image retrieval. our algorithm is based on a regression model which minimizes the least square error on the measured ( or, labeled ) images and simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure of the image space. specifically, we assume that if two images are sufficiently close to each other, then their measurements ( or, labels ) are close as well. by constructing a nearest neighbor graph, the geometrical structure of the image space can be described by the graph laplacian. we discuss how results from the field of optimal experimental design may be used to guide our selection of a subset of images, which gives us the most amount of information. experimental results on corel database suggest that the proposed approach achieves higher precision in relevance feedback image retrieval. categories and subject descriptors h.

[sep] a negotiation chain is formed when multiple related negotiations are spread over multiple agents. in order to appropriately order and structure the negotiations occurring in the chain so as to optimize the expected utility, we present an extension to a  concurrent negotiation framework. this work is aimed at semi cooperative multi agent systems, where each agent has its own goals and works to maximize its local utility however, the performance of each individual agent is tightly related to other agent s cooperation and the system s overall performance. we introduce a pre negotiation phase that allows agents to transfer meta level information. using this information, the agent can build a more accurate model of the negotiation in terms of modeling the relationship of flexibility and success probability. this more accurate model helps the agent in choosing a better negotiation solution in the global negotiation chain context. the agent can also use this information to allocate appropriate time for each negotiation, hence to find a good ordering of all related negotiations. the experimental data shows that these mechanisms improve the agents and the system s overall performance significantly. categories and subject descriptors i.

[sep] the winner determination problem in combinatorial auctions is the problem of determining the allocation of the items among the bidders that maximizes the sum of the accepted bid prices. while this problem is in general nphard, it is known to be feasible in polynomial time on those instances whose associated item graphs have bounded treewidth ( called structured item graphs ). formally, an item graph is a graph whose nodes are in one to one correspondence with items, and edges are such that for any bid, the items occurring in it induce a connected subgraph. note that many item graphs might be associated with a given combinatorial auction, depending on the edges selected for guaranteeing the connectedness. in fact, the tractability of determining whether a structured item graph of a fixed treewidth exists ( and if so, computing one ) was left as a crucial open problem. in this paper, we solve this problem by proving that the existence of a structured item graph is computationally intractable, even for treewidth [digit]. motivated by this bad news, we investigate different kinds of structural requirements that can be used to isolate tractable classes of combinatorial auctions. we show that the notion of hypertree decomposition, a recently introduced measure of hypergraph cyclicity, turns out to be most useful here. indeed, we show that the winner determination problem is solvable in polynomial time on instances whose bidder interactions can be represented with ( dual ) hypergraphs having bounded hypertree width. even more surprisingly, we show that the class of tractable instances identified by means of our approach properly contains the class of instances having a structured item graph. categories and subject descriptors j.

[sep] this paper addresses the problem of fair equilibrium selection in graphical games. our approach is based on the data structure called the best response policy, which was proposed by kearns et al. [digit] as a way to represent all nash equilibria of a graphical game. in [digit], it was shown that the best response policy has polynomial size as long as the underlying graph is a path. in this paper, we show that if the underlying graph is a bounded degree tree and the best response policy has polynomial size then there is an efficient algorithm which constructs a nash equilibrium that guarantees certain payoffs to all participants. another attractive solution concept is a nash equilibrium that maximizes the social welfare. we show that, while exactly computing the latter is infeasible ( we prove that solving this problem may involve algebraic numbers of an arbitrarily high degree ), there exists an fptas for finding such an equilibrium as long as the best response policy has polynomial size. these two algorithms can be combined to produce nash equilibria that satisfy various fairness criteria. categories and subject descriptors f.

[sep] multiattribute auction mechanisms generally either remain agnostic about traders preferences, or presume highly restrictive forms, such as full additivity. real preferences often exhibit dependencies among attributes, yet may possess some structure that can be usefully exploited to streamline communication and simplify operation of a multiattribute auction. we develop such a structure using the theory of measurable value functions, a cardinal utility representation based on an underlying order over preference differences. a set of local conditional independence relations over such differences supports a generalized additive preference representation, which decomposes utility across overlapping clusters of related attributes. we introduce an iterative auction mechanism that maintains prices on local clusters of attributes rather than the full space of joint configurations. when traders preferences are consistent with the auction s generalized additive structure, the mechanism produces approximately optimal allocations, at approximate vcg prices. categories and subject descriptors j.

[sep] we consider the problem of makespan minimization on m unrelated machines in the context of algorithmic mechanism design, where the machines are the strategic players. this is a multidimensional scheduling domain, and the only known positive results for makespan minimization in such a domain are o ( m ) approximation truthful mechanisms [digit], [digit]. we study a well motivated special case of this problem, where the processing time of a job on each machine may either be low or high, and the low and high values are public and job dependent. this preserves the multidimensionality of the domain, and generalizes the restricted machines ( i. e., pj, ) setting in scheduling. we give a general technique to convert any c approximation algorithm to a  truthful in expectation mechanism. this is one of the few known results that shows how to export approximation algorithms for a multidimensional problem into truthful mechanisms in a black box fashion. when the low and high values are the same for all jobs, we devise a deterministic [digit] approximation truthful mechanism. these are the first truthful mechanisms with non trivial performance guarantees for a multidimensional scheduling domain. our constructions are novel in two respects. first, we do not utilize or rely on explicit price definitions to prove truthfulness instead we design algorithms that satisfy cycle monotonicity. cycle monotonicity [digit] is a necessary and sufficient condition for truthfulness, is a generalization of value monotonicity for multidimensional domains. however, whereas value monotonicity has been used extensively and successfully to design truthful mechanisms in  domains, ours is the first work that leverages cycle monotonicity in the multidimensional setting. second, our randomized mechanisms are obtained by first constructing a fractional truthful mechanism for a fractional relaxation of the problem, and then converting it into a  expectation mechanism. this builds upon a technique of [digit], and shows the usefulness of fractional mechanisms in truthful mechanism design. categories and subject descriptors f.

[sep] in barter exchange markets, agents seek to swap their items with one another, in order to improve their own utilities. these swaps consist of cycles of agents, with each agent receiving the item of the next agent in the cycle. we focus mainly on the upcoming national kidney exchange market, where patients with kidney disease can obtain compatible donors by swapping their own willing but incompatible donors. with over [digit], [digit] patients already waiting for a cadaver kidney in the us, this market is seen as the only ethical way to significantly reduce the [digit], [digit] deaths per year attributed to kidney disease. the clearing problem involves finding a social welfare maximizing exchange when the maximum length of a cycle is fixed. long cycles are forbidden, since, for incentive reasons, all transplants in a cycle must be performed simultaneously. also, in barter exchanges generally, more agents are affected if one drops out of a longer cycle. we prove that the clearing problem with this cycle length constraint is np hard. solving it exactly is one of the main challenges in establishing a national kidney exchange. we present the first algorithm capable of clearing these markets on a nationwide scale. the key is incremental problem formulation. we adapt two paradigms for the task constraint generation and column generation. for each, we develop techniques that dramatically improve both runtime and memory usage. we conclude that column generation scales drastically better than constraint generation. our algorithm also supports several generalizations, as demanded by real world kidney exchanges. our algorithm replaced cplex as the clearing algorithm of the alliance for paired donation, one of the leading kidney exchanges. the match runs are conducted every two weeks and transplants based on our optimizations have already been conducted. categories and subject descriptors j.

[sep] in set system auctions, there are several overlapping teams of agents, and a task that can be completed by any of these teams. the auctioneer s goal is to hire a team and pay as little as possible. examples of this setting include shortest path auctions and vertex cover auctions. recently, karlin, kempe and tamir introduced a new definition of frugality ratio for this problem. informally, the frugality ratio is the ratio of the total payment of a mechanism to a desired payment bound. the ratio captures the extent to which the mechanism overpays, relative to perceived fair cost in a truthful auction. in this paper, we propose a new truthful polynomial time auction for the vertex cover problem and bound its frugality ratio. we show that the solution quality is with a constant factor of optimal and the frugality ratio is within a constant factor of the best possible worst case bound this is the first auction for this problem to have these properties. moreover, we show how to transform any truthful auction into a frugal one while preserving the approximation ratio. also, we consider two natural modifications of the definition of karlin et al., and we analyse the properties of the resulting payment bounds, such as monotonicity, computational hardness, and robustness with respect to the draw resolution rule. we study the relationships between the different payment bounds, both for general set systems and for specific set system auctions, such as path auctions and vertex cover auctions. we use these new definitions in the proof of our main result for vertex cover auctions via a bootstrapping technique, which may be of independent interest. categories and subject descriptors f.
